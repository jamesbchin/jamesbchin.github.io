                "Hello Mr. Bufford. I'm sorry to bother you, but the sink 
                isn't working?"
                <br><br>
                Bryan turned the knob, and a single drop of water came out, 
                dripping into the measuring cup he had placed underneath the faucet.
                <br><br>
                Mr. Bufford, the owner of the bakery, was a big man; kneading dough 
                and lifting large bags of flour had been his whole life. Every day was 
                arm day. He looked into the sink while turning the knob. Nothing came 
                out this time.
                <br><br>
                He let out a sigh. "I swear I paid the water bill this month. Let 
                me call the plumber."
                <br><br>
                Mr. Bufford walked back into a small room in the back of the bakery; 
                his office was honestly more of a glorified closet than a room. He came 
                back with an envelope, and said, “See? I did pay this month!” He walked 
                over to the landline.
                <br><br>
                Bryan looked through the window in the door, the barrier between the 
                calm of the kitchen and the passive aggressiveness of the customers. 
                He shook his head before wiping his hands on his apron and walking 
                through the door.
                The room was warm and stuffy; the air conditioning wasn’t working either. 
                A single fan mounted on the wall was the only thing fighting the heat of 
                the outside summer air.
                <br><br>
                A woman was standing at the check out area, tapping her feet on the 
                ground. “Excuse me,” She said, in a very rude tone. “When will the 
                bread be ready?”
                <br><br>
                Bryan apologized profusely, and explained the situation to her. When he 
                finished, she shook her head, mumbling some racial slurs, and then walked 
                out. The next few people on the line responded similarly. One person even 
                asked to see the manager. Mr. Bufford didn’t dare come out.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, after Bryan got to everyone, he walked back inside the kitchen. 
                He let out a sigh of frustration. Mr. Bufford was sitting in his big closet 
                with his head in his hands. Mr. Bufford lifted his head a little, barely 
                enough to see who had just walked in.
                <br><br>
                “The plumber won’t be available until next week. I don’t know what to do.”

                All-Mon-Dakery. It's almost too easy. Mr. Bufford’s signature is a small 
                amount of almond flavoring in each of his pastries. He even has a nut-free 
                almond bread loaf, which has never ceased to amaze me. You know what else 
                tastes like almonds? Cyanide. It’s almost as if Fate decided to write in 
                one of the biggest murder mystery clichés into my life story.
                <br><br>
                I work at this bakery, this little hole in the wall. To be honest, I really 
                don’t particularly like the bread? But it’s a job and I need money, and 
                Mr. Bufford is a family friend. Working here has been pretty good. I have 
                flexible hours, I get free bread (hey, free bread is free bread, no matter 
                how good it is), and above all else, Mr. Bufford is a great guy. He’s an 
                amazing baker, and he’s an understanding boss.
                <br><br>
                Which is why I need to do this.
                <br><br>
                Our customers are, to put it nicely, assholes. I swear the only reason they 
                come to our bakery is because almond bread is the new hip thing. Some random, 
                health related study came out relating almonds to the fountain of youth story. 
                It’s all over the news.
                <br><br>
                But it’s driving me nuts (do you see what I did there?). I need to get rid 
                of these pieces of garbage. Mr. Bufford doesn’t deserve this.
                <br><br>
                And so, I devised a plan.

                “Mr. Bufford? I have a hose in my car, we can hook it up to the back and 
                just run it to the sink?” said Bryan, pulling his keys out of his pocket. 
                Mr. Bufford looked up from his hands, his eyes filling with hope. “That 
                sounds like a great idea Bryan! Let’s do that.”
                <br><br>

                So, the plan is simple. Block up the pipes, so that we need to bring water in from outside. 
                Make sure to bring a hose and hook it up to a tank of water and cyanide. Then, make a 
                batch of bread with this water, and hand it out to the people that we don’t like. 
                Cyanide, almonds, same thing.
                <br><br>
                Easy.

                Water was now coming into the bakery. Bryan grabbed some flour and mixed it 
                with the water. A few other ingredients later, and a new batch of pastries 
                were made.
                <br><br>
                He started giving them out to people, one by one. The counter of annoying 
                people in the world slowly went down in his head as he further saved his boss 
                from the terribleness of his customers.
                <br><br>
                Once the bakery slowed down a little, Bryan walked back into the kitchen 
                with an empty tray. “Mr. Bufford? Are you doing alright?”
                <br><br>
                No response.
                <br><br>
                Bryan went looking around. Mr. Bufford wasn’t sitting at his desk, nor was 
                he in the kitchen itself.
                <br><br>
                Just as Bryan was about to leave, he noticed a mass on the floor in the office. 
                Mr. Bufford lay motionless next to the corner of his desk.
                <br><br>
                His hands were full of crumbs, and a single loaf of bread lay on the floor next to his face.
