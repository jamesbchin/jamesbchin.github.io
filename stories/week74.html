            <p>Week 74</p> <!-- July 10th to July 16th -->

                Taylor strapped their latest device onto their left wrist. It 
                was a little chonky, requiring two velcro straps to keep it on their 
                arm. They flipped the power switch and the start-up loading screen 
                came on. After a few seconds, the screen faded to black, leaving a 
                few digits on the screen.

                "07.16.2023
                <br>
                4:55am"
                <br><br>
                Taylor quickly glanced over at the phone sitting on their desk. 
                "July 16th, 2023. 4:55am".
                <br><br>
                They jumped out of their chair. It worked! They had built a functioning 
                TPS. It's like a watch, but cooler. A Time Positioning System, capable 
                of giving the user their exact local time (pre calibrated for timezone, 
                of course).
                <br><br>
                <br>
                Walking to summer prep school was exciting today, which was abnormal 
                since the incident. Taylor's best friend, Charlie, moved to a new school 
                last year, and things haven't been a same since. They used to talk every 
                night over the phone, sometimes until morning. But over time, the two of 
                them slowly drifted apart.
                <br><br>
                Taylor put their earbuds in to listen to the radio. It was old fashioned, 
                but listening to the ever changing lists of songs made them feel like time 
                was moving on, that the present was rapidly becoming the past and therefore 
                it should be treasured and remembered.
                <br><br>
                "Playing now is this week's top song, "vampire" by Olivia Rodrigo. I'll 
                see you on the other side!"
                <br><br>
                Taylor stopped and closed their eyes, taking a breath, listening to the song. 
                They let the song flood through their ears for a moment.
                <br><br>
                And then someone bumped into them.
                <br><br>
                "Taylorrrrrr!"
                <br><br>
                They opened their eyes. And there was Charlie.
                <br><br>
                "What's wrong with you? Why do you look so surprised," they said, giving 
                their friend a light punch in the arm.
                <br><br>
                Taylor just looked up, confused.
                <br><br>
                "Oh wow, what is this?" Charlie said, lifting Taylor's left arm.
                <br><br>
                Taylor wiped their eyes. "Um. It's my latest project; it's a TPS."
                <br><br>
                Charlie looked down at the screen. "Well, the date is wrong. It says July 16th, 2022."
