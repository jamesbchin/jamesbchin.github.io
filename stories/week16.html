                Susan was playing in the front yard, just like she does every 
                Saturday morning. Her parents were sitting on their porch bench, 
                reading on their e-readers. Every now and then they'd look up, making 
                sure that Susan was okay. But they generally gave Susan the freedom 
                to be independent, only really coming to her aid if she calls for them.
                <br><br>
                Today's adventure was the family oak tree. It was planted by Susan's 
                grandfather, back when he was still a child. The tree is now at least 
                50 or so years old, and has felt like a part of the family ever since. 
                Susan often plays with the tree but, something was different about it 
                today. On this slightly chilly, early autumn day, the tree almost seemed 
                to be calling out to her.
                <br><br>
                The usual activity with the tree involves Susan sitting under its 
                leaves and telling stories. She tells the tree about her day, her 
                family, friends, school, or whatever else is on her mind. The tree 
                has become a sorta friend to her, someone who will sit there and listen 
                to everything she has to say. Almost like a pen pal; someone who you 
                constantly update on your life, but doesn't really play a major role in it.
