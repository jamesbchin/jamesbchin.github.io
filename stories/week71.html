                "Heyy, is anyone sitting here?"
                <br><br>
                Jessica looked down at the word counter of her Microsoft Word
                document. 26 words. 26 more words in this obituary than she
                had this morning, when she arrived at the cafe. She sighed and
                closed her laptop, before lifting her cup of tea up to her mouth
                to take a sip. She looked up, and almost spit her tea out. The
                man standing in front of her was, quite the specimen. Tall,
                cleanly shaven, hair with just enough product in it the hold
                shape but not enough to look tacky. He had a blue blazer on
                over a navy sweater vest. His hand sat the chair in front of her.
                <br><br>
                "Yes, my friend is grabbing a drink right now. She'll be right
                back."
                <br><br>
                He looked around. The cafe was quiet; only a few people were
                still there that late into the night. It was near closing time; the
                staff could be seen cleaning up the kitchen.
                <br><br>
                "Are you sure? I don't see anyone on line, and the pickup area
                looks pretty empty too," he said. "I was going to ask if you
                minded if I joined you but, since you lied about having a friend
                here I assume you do mind."
                <br><br>
                Jessica sat there with her face starting to turn red. "I'm sorry, I
                didn't want to be rude. I just, need to be alone right now."
                <br><br>
                The cheeky smile on his face turned into a frown. "I'm sorry. I
                understand. I hope you have a lovely day... I mean night. Or
                evening."
                <br><br>
                The strange dude turned to leave. Jessica looked at him
                suspiciously. It wouldn't be the first time some weird guy hit on
                her, and she was sure it wouldn't be the last. After a moment,
                she rolled her eyes, followed by a small smile. She called out,
                "Hey! Hold up."
                <br><br>
                He was almost at the door when he looked back at her. "What's
                up?"
                <br><br>
                "Why did you come over?"
                <br><br>
                He just looked at her for a second, before saying, "To be honest,
                I just kinda needed to talk to someone. You see, my father just
                passed away and I went on a walk to get some air and well, this
                cafe is where we used to grab morning tea every morning
                before..." He stopped mid-sentence. "Anyway, that's enough of
                that. What are you up to?
                <br><br>
                ***
                <br><br>
                The cafe closed not too long after. Her word count still read 26
                words. The two of them left the cafe, and he offered to walk her
                home.
                <br><br>
                It was a chilly evening. It was apparent in the brisk air that
                winter was coming. He took off his jacket and handed it to her,
                as they walked through the streets of the city.
                <br><br>
                Their conversation began with stories of their parents, him his
                father and her her mother. The exchanged treasured memories,
                and also regrets. As they continued walking, they began talking
                about other things, like work and their personal lives. They
                talked about his dog and her cat. They talked about the terrible
                rent prices and the struggles of the increasing cost of living.
                They talked about how they've both always wondered why
                suspicious smoke is always venting out from the streets of the
                city. They walked for miles and miles, but eventually they made
                it to her front door.
                <br><br>
                Jessica offered the jacket back, and he took it and placed it over
                his back.
                <br><br>
                "Thank you for the evening. I'm glad I decided to stop by your
                table."
                <br><br>
                She offered him a hug. "Thank you too!"
                <br><br>
                They let go, slowly releasing each other from their arms. He
                looked into her eyes, and smiled. "I'll see you around, Jessica."
                <br><br>
                He turned around, and walked away. She walked up the stairs to
                her apartment building. As she pulled out her keys, she turned
                back around. "Wait! We should exchange phone numbers!"
                <br><br>
                But he was gone, like a wisp of smoke, lifted by the winter air.
