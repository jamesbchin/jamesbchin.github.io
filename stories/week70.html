            <h5>The Chamber</h5>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                The chamber was surprisingly comfy. It was well lit, but not blinding. 
                It was warm, but not enough to induce sweating. There was light classical 
                music playing in the background. All of these things could be controlled 
                via an app on my phone, but I didn't feel the need.
                <br><br>
                I stood there for a little while; they said I could take all the time 
                I needed. There was a button on the inside of the chamber to start the 
                timer. Five minutes of exchanging the oxygen in the chamber with the inert 
                but useless gas, nitrogen. Five minutes of slowly growing more and more 
                sleepy until the end comes.
                <br><br>
                I never thought I'd use something like this. To be honest, I thought I would 
                go out with a bigger bang. But these chambers became legal recently and it 
                was pretty cheap so, I decided to give it a go.
                <br><br>
                The registration process is quite... interesting, for lack of a better descriptor. 
                You go on their website, fill out a form. There's a cute, and mildly insensitive 
                animation about the whole process, once you've signed all of the paperwork. It 
                explains it pretty clearly, though. You make a reservation, walk in, jump into 
                your designated chamber, and then, you know.
                <br><br>
                I don't know how long I've been standing here. The first thing I did when I got 
                in was look through my messages. I had a quite a few that I haven't answered yet, 
                so I figured I should answer them. I started writing the first one but, I gave up.
                <br><br>
                I hit the button. A voice came on, "You have... five... minutes remaining."
                <br><br>
                I let out a sigh, and unlocked my phone. I decided to remove my passcode since, 
                I wouldn't really need it anymore. Maybe someone else could take the phone and use it.
                <br><br>
                "You have... four... minutes remaining."
                <br><br>
                I open my gallery app. I haven't taken many photos recently but, there were some good 
                old ones. I used to go on walks, and I would take pictures of the different animals 
                I'd see. Blurry photos of birds, the different colored beetles and ants. Some 
                landscape scenes that I thought looked kinda cool.
                <br><br>
                "You have... three.. minutes remaining."
                <br><br>
                I scrolled back a little farther. Pictures of my older sister, before the accident. 
                We used to hangout a lot. Every month, when we had a chance, we would go to this 
                local coffee shop. She would tell me all about her new job or her latest project or 
                whatever else was going on in her life.
                <br><br>
                We were going to go on a trip together. I was so excited about it; I called her one 
                day just to tell her that. To tell her how much I really wanted to go. But before I 
                had a chance to say anything, she got hit. Someone ran a red light and...
                <br><br>
                "You have... two... minutes remaining."
                <br><br>
                A tear rolled down my eyes. My phone buzzed. I got an email notification.
                <br><br>

                I clicked the link. It was a letter, from her. My sister.

                Hello Charlie,
                <br>
                As you probably remember, we are about to go on that long vacation to Europe! I just 
                wanted to send you this message ahead of time. I'm sure the trip was awesome and I'm 
                sure we had a blast. I hope we are still close, and I hope we still meet up every month.
                <br>
                I know you've been struggling lately. I'm sorry I haven't been as helpful as you needed. 
                I hope this trip pulls you out of your head a little.
                <br>
                I'll see you soon Charlie.
                <br>
                With love,
                <br>
                Sis

                There were pictures attached. I clicked the link, but they wouldn't load.
                <br><br>
                "Wait. Stop! Let me out. Please!" I felt drowsy. My legs started to feel like jello.
                <br><br>
                I kept clicking. The download progress wheel came up.

                A selfie, of me and her popped up, as my eyes closed for the last time.
