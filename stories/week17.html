            <h5>A Basket of Mangos and Clementines</h5>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                "Melissaaa!"
                <br><br>
                Jamie frantically waved her best friend over, holding a bright royal 
                blue swatch in her other hand. The girls were on a mission: to pick a color 
                to paint a merry-go-round. Melissa ran over and looked at the swatch. They both 
                nodded and ran over to their parents to show them their selection.
                <br><br>
                An hour or so later, the two five years old's, with huge brushes and painting 
                smocks that were several sizes too large were sitting and painting the brand-new 
                merry-go-round. They spent all day painting. That night, they walked back home 
                from the mostly blue merry-go-round, with their now very blue smocks.
                <br><br>

                <br>
                The playground was built on a very small piece of land, bought by the parents 
                and grandparents of the families that lived nearby. Adults from all over the 
                community came together to build the playground. People donated old furniture, 
                scrap metal and wood. Towards the end, the kids were allowed to paint the various 
                structures in whatever colors they wanted.
                <br><br>
                Jamie and Melissa came every day after school. They always met at their merry-go-round 
                with a picnic basket that Melissa's mom made for them. If someone was at the 
                merry-go-round, they would sit and wait patiently until it became available, and 
                then sat down to eat their snacks. Mango slices for Jamie, and clementine slices 
                for Melissa. They spent their afternoons talking about their friends at school, 
                schoolwork, all of the drama. Secret stuff, for each other's ears only.
                <br><br>
                <center>***</center>
                <br>
                "Mango slices for you, clementine slices for me."
                <br><br>
                The center of the merry-go-round has a rectangle worn into the fading blue paint, 
                and Melissa places the basket into it. She takes a seat and opens the top of the 
                basket. She pulls out two forks and two large plastic containers full of fruits.
                <br><br>
                "What do you do with the mangos after you leave?" asked Jaime, still standing.
                <br><br>
                Melissa opens the containers and place them down on the merry-go-round. She pokes 
                the forks through one of the fruits in each container. She put her hands in her 
                lap and lets out a sigh.
                <br><br>
                "What do you mean? I eat the clementines, you eat the mangos, and I clean the 
                containers out at home."
                <br><br>
                Melissa took the fork out from her clementine container and put the slice into her mouth.
                <br><br>
                Jaime let out a sigh of her own and joined her friend sitting down on the merry-go-round.
                <br><br>
                "So how's the new school? Have you made any new friends yet?" Jaime asks. She 
                pretends to take a bite of a mango.
                <br><br>
                "I haven't really been looking, they all seem pretty lame," Melissa responds, eating 
                another clementine slice, "Besides, I have you."
                <br><br>
                "Melissa, you can't rely on me forever."
                <br><br>
                "Why not." Melissa eats another two clementine slices, the fork shaking in her hand.
                <br><br>
                "I'm not even actually here," Jaime stands and turns away, with her hand on her forehead.
                <br><br>
                "Yes, you are."
                <br><br>
                "No. I'm not. You need to move on."
                <br><br>
                "NO." Melissa thrusts herself up with her hands, but her legs buckle under her, and the 
                fork goes flying. It bounces off the merry-go-round, and flies through Jaime. She falls to the ground.
                <br><br>
                "MELISSA! ARE YOU OKAY?" Jaime tries to help her friend but, her hands go right 
                through Melissa's body.
                <br><br>
                <center>***</center>
                <br>
                "It's not your fault."
                <br><br>
                <center>***</center>
                <br>
                "Faster faster! I wasn't even dizzy that time."
                <br><br>
                The merry-go-round in the playground was made primarily out of wood. The round disc that 
                spins around is a large wooden sheet, mounted to a very large weather-proof bearing. The 
                rails that stick up from the large disc, however, is made of PVC piping. The whole 
                structure is painted in a bright royal blue.
                <br><br>
                Melissa jumped off the disc and grabbed one of the rails.
                <br><br>
                "Hold on!" she yelled as she started running around the circle. As she ran around, she 
                was laughing so hard that tears came out of her eyes. She kept running, faster and 
                faster and faster. When the disc was turning as fast as she could possibly make it go, 
                she jumped on.
                <br><br>
                As she jumped on, Jaime went flying off.
                <br><br>
                Melissa didn't see her friend in the center of the merry-go-round. She frantically 
                looked around and saw someone lying on the ground, just outside of the merry-go-round. 
                It was Jaime. She tried to jump off to see her friend but she slipped and hit her 
                head on the ground.
                <br><br>
                <center>***</center>
                <br>
                "You are very lucky to be alive Melissa."
                <br><br>
                <center>***</center>
                <br>
                "HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO OUR DAUGHTER? HOW COULD YOU BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE."
                <br><br>
                <center>***</center>
                <br>
                "We are going to send her to PT. But the likelihood that she will ever use her legs 
                again is very slim. She will need a wheelch… wait… She's awake. We can talk outside."
                <br><br>
                <center>***</center>
                <br>
                "Melissa? Melissa? Can you hear me? MELISSA"
                <br><br>
                Melissa slowly opened her eyes.
                <br><br>
                "Jaime?"
                <br><br>
                "I'm here."
                <br><br>
                She lifts herself up with her arms and shifts her body over to her wheelchair. She 
                slowly climbs up onto the seat, and then wheels herself over to the merry-go-round.
                <br><br>
                "I'm sorry," Melissa whispers. A tear comes down her cheek and drops onto her lap. 
                She puts the containers of fruit into the picnic basket and places the basket onto 
                her lap.
                <br><br>
                "It wasn't your fault."
                <br><br>
                "Yes it was. If I didn't spin you around that fast, we…"
                <br><br>
                "MELISSA STOP."
                <br><br>
                Melissa let her head drop, her eye staring blankly at the ground in front of her. 
                Jaime kneeled down and placed her hands around Melissa's hands.
                <br><br>
                "If you don't let go of the past, if you won’t forgive yourself, I am going to leave."
                <br><br>
                Melissa's head shot up. "You wouldn't."
                <br><br>
                Jaime stood back up. Her already less than opaque figure slowly started to fade.
                <br><br>
                "You can't!"
                <br><br>
                "Do you forgive yourself?" Jaime took a step backward, still fading.
                <br><br>
                "JAIME NO."
                <br><br>
                "I'm sorry." Jaime took one more step back, and faded to nothing.
                <br><br>
                "Jaime?"
                <br><br>
                "Jaime?"
                <br><br>
                "JAIME"
