            <h3>one story per week</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Week 8</p> <!-- April 4th to April 10th -->
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                "Sir, we're approaching the planet."
                <br><br>
                "Drop us out of FTL, slow us down right behind the moon."
                <br><br>
                The captain tapped the large touch screen display on his right side arm rest. "Attention. We are coming out of FTL now. Non-essential personnel please stay in your quarters. Everyone else, prepare for battle." The captains calm but stern voice came over the loud speaker. He sat down in the captain's chair, facing the large front glass of the starship. The stars were starting to fade back into view as the starship's FTL drives were powered down.
                <br><br>
                The red moon came into view as the starship came to a stop. "Send out the drones."
                <br><br>
                The two cargo bay doors on the left and right sides of the starship opened, and a stream of drones were ejected out into space. They were tasked with flying past the moon to determine the threat. Each drone is equipped with a large array of cameras and sensors, used by it's AI for automated self guidance, and is then sent back to the starship for further processing and display.
                <br><br>
                "Data is coming in now, sir."
                <br><br>
                The front glass doubled as a display, similar to a HUD, but much larger. The starship took the raw data coming from the drones and generated a live three-dimensional image of the planet and surrounding space.
                <br><br>
                "It looks like there are two enemy battle cruisers and their escorts. They don't look like they know we're here. How should we proceed?"
                <br><br>
                The captain detached the touchscreen from his chair and walked over to the front glass with it. He swiped a screen from his display up to the front glass.
                <br><br>
                The captain tapped the small device embedded in his ear.
                <br><br>
                "Engineering, this is the bridge, can we open a wormhole yet?"
                <br><br>
                "Yes sir. And no sir. We do not have enough power to open one big enough for the whole starship."
                <br><br>
                "What about our fighters?"
                <br><br>
                "That could work."
                <br><br>
                "Open it."
                <br><br>
                The captain tapped his ear again. "We are going to send our automated fighters through a wormhole, and then flank them with our starship."
