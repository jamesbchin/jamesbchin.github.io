            <p>Week 10</p> <!-- April 18th to April 24th -->
            <br />

                "We sent a signal, out into the stars. It simply contained two positions: the starting 
                position, and the target position."
                <br><br>
                Dr. Martin was giving a presentation on the progress of his team's latest project. They 
                had developed a method for teleporting large objects through space. It was a momentous 
                occasion, and so they invited the best and brightest to attend.
                <br><br>
                "I will now demonstrate our invention."
                <br><br>
                Dr. Martin took the pencil from behind his ear and placed it into the machine. The 
                audience stared intently as he closed the opaque tinted glass door of the machine. He 
                punched in some commands into the control panel located on the side of the machine, and 
                then stepped back as the machine started making whirring sounds. He walked over to the 
                nearly identical machine on the other side of the stage. The first machine went silent, 
                and an indicator light on the second machine lit up. The doctor opens the door of the 
                second machine and he pulls out his pencil, completely unscathed.
                <br><br>
                The audience applauded. He received a standing ovation. Dr. Martin bowed, and left 
                the stage.

                "Where does that radio signal go?"
                <br><br>
                "I'm not sure, to be honest."
