                Note from Me: This is an old poem I wrote back in, November of 2020. I figured it
                fit this prompt, so I added this poem here.

                You fiddle.
                <br>
                You look at the map.
                <br>
                You step on that forbidden yellow line,
                <br>
                and look over the edge.
                <br>
                "Where is the train?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Read a book. Solve a puzzle.
                <br>
                Skim a newspaper.
                <br>
                <br>
                A light appears, far away but slowly
                <br>
                coming
                <br>
                nearer.
                <br>
                <br>
                You jump. You're excited!
                <br>
                It has finally
                <br>
                arrived.
                <br>
                <br>
                The doors open. You run inside.
                <br>
                "Stand clear for the closing doors please."
                <br>
                Two tones. Clunk.
                <br>
                You are on your way.
