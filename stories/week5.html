                    Every writer gets to write this story only once. The story about how 
                    they have no idea what to write. The "Writer's Block" story. The story 
                    where the writer talks about how they have so many ideas, but also none. 
                    The science fiction story, the fantasy, maybe even a p---

                "Hey James! What are you up to?"
                <br>
                <br>
                A girl comes walking down the hall, seeing her friend sitting at a random desk 
                in the computer science building. She's carrying her large backpack, full of 
                all the textbooks and notebooks required for her first year at college. One 
                day she would be like James, carrying one small little bag with just a folder 
                and a tablet.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Nothing nothing, just trying to write my story for the week."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Oh what, you write a story every week?"
                <br>
                <br>
                James sits back in his chair, stretching his arms up towards the ceiling. He 
                takes off his mask so he can take a sip of his Fanta, the bottle he just bought 
                from the vending machine around the corner.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well, I try to. I missed last week unfortunately."
                <br>
                <br>
                He opens the bottle of Fanta and takes a sip. He can feel his teeth rotting 
                away from the sugar in his drink. He lifts up the bottle and takes a look at 
                the Nutrition Facts. 73 grams.

                "Hey look, they're leaving the classroom. We can go in and print the posters now."
