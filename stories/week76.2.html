            <p>Week 76.1</p> <!-- July 24th to July 30th -->

            <h5>A dark shadow</h5>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                “Oh my god shut up.”
                <br><br>
                I tried slamming my alarm’s snooze button. Except I wasn’t 
                in bed, and the alarm was not my bedside clock.
                <br><br>
                I instantly sat up in my chair. I was in our space station’s engine 
                room. I went to grab the control panel screen to pull it into view 
                when sharp pains shot through my arm. I noticed drops of blood 
                floating in front of me.
                <br><br>
                “First aid kit, where’s the first aid kit…”
                <br><br>
                The world went black.
                <br><br>
                ***
                <br><br>
                The alarms were still ringing. I woke up again. Blood is… well… 
                there’s a reason I never became a doctor.
                <br><br>
                With a lot of effort and teeth gritting, I managed to pull the 
                screen over. It was cracked, and blank.
                <br><br>
                I slammed my hands into the control panel. It hurt, a lot. And to be 
                honest, my frustration didn’t go away. On the bright side, the alarm 
                stopped ringing. I unbuckled the seat belt that kept me from floating 
                out of my chair, allowing me to move. I looked around for the first 
                aid kit, but it wasn’t in its usual spot.
                <br><br>
                The alarms must have deafened me a lot because, my hearing slowly started 
                coming back. The entrance to this section of the station was closed. Several 
                loud noises were coming from the other side. Banging, yelling, weapons fire.
                <br><br>
                My hand immediately snapped to my holster. Empty.
                <br><br>
                I need to stop making sharp actions.
                <br><br>
                I decided to fight my fears and just, look down at my arm. There was a deep 
                gash going up my forearm. I almost threw up, but then I remembered that I 
                was in space, and so I tried my absolute best to hold it in. I need to dress 
                this wound.
                <br><br>
                I slowly navigated myself over to the entrance. There was a display on the 
                side of the door. I pulled up the live security footage. It seemed empty, 
                no one was anywhere. And then, all of a sudden, I saw a dark shadow fly by 
                the door. And then another. These dark shadows seemed to keep coming, although 
                sporadically. I kept watching for a little while, until one came over to the 
                security camera and just, stopped, as if it knew I was watching it.
                <br><br>
                I jumped, or well, as much as one could jump in zero gravity. I wanted to hide, 
                I wanted to scream but, I’m already behind a door and, screaming while scary 
                monsters are outside seems like an unintelligent idea.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, I got out of my head and went back to the screen. The dark shadow 
                was gone. I tried searching for the closest first aid kit. The system notified 
                me that all wall mounted first aid kits are unavailable, except for the one in 
                the observatory.
                <br><br>
                So. Injured arm, totally bleeding out, evil dark shadow monsters, and I’m all 
                alone. Sounds like a space mission from hell. Or from a poorly written story 
                by a 25 year old engineer with no life.
                <br><br>
                I looked at the security footage again. It looked like the coast was clear. I 
                punched in my command code into the door controls and after a few alarms, the 
                door slowly unlocked and opened.
                <br><br>
                Something really cool and weird about being on a space station is, well, there’s 
                no up or down. And so, in an attempt to keep whatever happened in my past behind 
                me, I oriented myself such that the observatory was forward and the engine room 
                was behind me.
                <br><br>
                I pulled myself along, as fast as I could. Unfortunately, I’m a righty, and my 
                right arm was the arm that was damaged. I wish I trained my left arm more…
                <br><br>
                Eventually, after a lot of pulling, I started hearing sounds again. People were 
                yelling. They sounded like they were in pain!
                <br><br>
                I started looking around for a weapon. The armory wasn’t too far away, so I pulled 
                myself over to it. I punched in my code, but it didn’t work. I just got a message, 
                “Unauthorized”. I got mad again and slammed my hands on the door. I guess it was 
                unlocked or broken or something because, it opened?
                <br><br>
                It was cleaned out, there was nothing in there. So I turned around, and there it 
                was. A big dark shadow. It had a pistol in its… hands? It outstretched its 
                ghostly form and left the pistol in front of me, before quickly floating away.
                <br><br>
                Confused, I grabbed the pistol and holstered it. I closed the armory door and 
                pulled myself to the observatory.
                <br><br>
                I punched my code in and unlocked the door. Inside were several dead bodies. I 
                turned back around. I couldn’t hold it in this time.
                <br><br>
                I closed the door, leaving suspicious colored liquid floating outside. I tried 
                not looking at the bodies floating around. But I couldn’t help but notice that, 
                there were lifeless shadows in the room too. It was as if something came and 
                shot them all.
                <br><br>
                The observatory controls were still active, so I pulled myself over to the 
                control panel. The live view was pitch black, which was odd out in space. 
                There were no stars.
                <br><br>
                I tried rewinding the saved video recording from that day. It appears there 
                were stars at the start of the day.
                <br><br>
                And then I started hearing screaming again, outside the door. It seemed to be coming closer.
                <br><br>
                I tried playing the video recording faster. A shape started coming into focus.
                <br><br>
                The screaming got even louder.
                <br><br>
                The shape was a really big dark shadow. It was coming closer, close enough to dock.
                <br><br>
                The screaming was even closer now.
                <br><br>
                And then the big dark shadow got shot by something. The camera turned. Another 
                space ship had arrived, and was shooting the black shadow.
                <br><br>
                The screaming became knocking, which became banging on the door.
                <br><br>
                The video recording caught up to the live feed. The ship in the video started 
                shooting the station too. It hit the observatory lens.
                <br><br>
                The feed went dark, and the observatory door slammed open.
