                A smartphone's custom alarm rings on a bedside table in a small town in the middle 
                of somewhere. A pair of arms emerge, stretching out under the bed covers. A loud yawn, 
                and the arms come down. 6:00 AM; the start of a mailman's day. He jumps out of bed, 
                ready to start his daily routine. Takes a shower, brushes his teeth, and then onto 
                the kitchen where he cooks his breakfast: oatmeal with various fruits (raspberry is 
                his favorite), some milk, and a touch of honey. Before eating, he opens the window 
                to let in the cool autumn air. He takes a deep breath, and smiles. A perfect day to 
                go for a walk.

                The porcelain bowl, stainless steel pot and spoon are rinsed in the sink, and then 
                placed into the washing machine. Dish soap, close the door, button two, five, and 
                then the one at the very end. One last quick trip to the restroom, and then it's time 
                to put on some proper clothes.

            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                A dull blue bag, worn but obviously well maintained, hangs from a hook mounted to 
                the wall next to the door. The color of the bronze hook looks polished where the bag 
                strap sits. The bag has a pocket for a water bottle, some extra socks and a little 
                pouch full of daily essentials: pen, paper, house keys, etc. A blue jacket and hat both 
                rest on a simple coat hanger, also by the door. The post office logo sits proudly on 
                the jacket shoulder sleeve.

            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                The mailman sits down on a little stool by the door and he puts on his freshly shined 
                shoes. Left foot, then right foot, "Double Slip Knot" on both. He stands, puts on his 
                jacket and hat, and throws on his bag over his shoulder. He opens the door, walks 
                through, and takes out his keys.

            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                "HOLY SHIT I am so gonna die." â€¦ is what I thought that day.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                I didn't think it was possible for anything to move that fast, and never did I think 
                something that fast would be coming at ME. Except maybe when I bring home a freshly 
                hunted rabbit for my pups. They definitely come at me pretty fast.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                I thought about them, that day. Little Ginger is only a couple days old, just 
                popped out of my mate. She's so cute, the little one. She definitely gets her genes 
                from her mother.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                I thought, why was I so dumb, tripping over a crack in the ground, breaking my leg 
                when I did. Now some massive creature is gonna come eat me, and my mate will have 
                to fend for herself and our three little pups.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                How could I put her through that.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                You know, now that I think about it, I was gonna take my son, Acorns, out to a 
                beautiful cliff that night. It over looks the whole forest-- the little cavern we 
                live in, the river we get our water, the patch of grass we run around in. You can 
                see the sunset from up there, it makes the whole sky turn an unworldly gradient of colors.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                I found the spot while taking a walk the other day.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                I thought I wouldn't be able to take him there anymore.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                But then, you stumbled across a wounded fox, on the side of the road. You stopped 
                your big box, and climbed out. You wrapped up my leg up in something, and you let me go.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                And for that, I thank you.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                I owe you one, big not-fox looking creature.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                I hope to meet you again some day.
