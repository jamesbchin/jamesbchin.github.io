            <p>Week 2.1</p> <!-- February 21st to February 27th -->
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                "Something bothering you?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Startled, the kid takes his forehead out of his hands, immediately sitting straight 
                up, as if someone had poked his side and ran away. He took a quick look around the 
                station, trying to figure out who was talking to him.
                <br>
                <br>
                He sat alone on a wooden bench. The station was quiet, there were only a few people 
                around. Some with their noses in books, other with their dreary eyes glued to their 
                smartphone screens. A few were sleeping, leaning on the poles holding up the station roof. 
                It was late, the kid was coming back from his job working as a barista at the local late 
                night coffee shop.
                <br>
                <br>
                The voice spoke again, "Stop looking around doofus, I'm on the phone. You must be using 
                your new earbuds again."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Oh… right… sorry about that."
                <br>
                <br>
                "It's good dude, no biggie. What's stressing you out?"
                <br>
                <br>
                He didn't remember calling anyone, much less who he would call at this hour. But he 
                appreciated the company nonetheless.
                <br>
                <br>
                "What if I really am just a terrible person?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "What makes you say that?"
                <br>
                <br>
                He leans back in the chair, thinking back to his earlier interaction with his classmate 
                at school.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well, I told, what's his name, Stephen? I told him that he was a terrible programmer 
                with no future because he didn't finish his part of the group project in time."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well, is he a terrible programmer?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well, to be honest, I am a much better programmer than he is. I swear Brenden wouldn't 
                be able to program a toaster if his life depended on it."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well screw him then!"
                <br>
                <br>
                "But maybe I was too hard on him, you know? What if he was just busy or somet…"
                <br>
                <br>
                "No, evidently this guy is useless. You need to drop him."
                <br>
                <br>
                "You sure?
                <br>
                <br>
                "Look, is he useless? Does he contribute anything to the team?"
                <br>
                <br>
                He pauses for a moment. He thinks for a moment, and then stands up.
                <br>
                <br>
                "You know what, you're right. Who needs Brayden anyways."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Yeah there you go!"
                <br>
                <br>
                "He's probably one of those babies that cries to their babysitters."
                <br>
                <br>
                "That's right!"
                <br>
                <br>
                A light appears from the nearby tunnel. A train whistle goes off, and the wind from 
                the incoming train blows by.
                <br>
                <br>
                "You know what, I'll kick him off the team tomorrow. This god damn kid is bringing 
                down the team."
                <br>
                <br>
                "That's the spirit!"
                <br>
                <br>
                The train comes to a stop, and the doors open.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Thanks man, I really needed that."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Any time bro."
                <br>
                <br>
                The kid walks through the double doors. They close and the train starts moving. 
                He takes a seat by the window. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his earbuds, and 
                starts playing some music.

            <hr />

            <p>Week 1.1</p>
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                "HOLY SHIT I am so gonna die." … is what I thought that day.
                <br>
                <br>
                I didn't think it was possible for anything to move that fast, and never did I think 
                something that fast would be coming at ME. Except maybe when I bring home a freshly 
                hunted rabbit for my pups. They definitely come at me pretty fast.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought about them, that day. Little Ginger is only a couple days old, just 
                popped out of my mate. She's so cute, the little one. She definitely gets her genes 
                from her mother.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought, why was I so dumb, tripping over a crack in the ground, breaking my leg 
                when I did. Now some massive creature is gonna come eat me, and my mate will have 
                to fend for herself and our three little pups.
                <br>
                <br>
                How could I put her through that.
                <br>
                <br>
                You know, now that I think about it, I was gonna take my son, Acorns, out to a 
                beautiful cliff that night. It over looks the whole forest-- the little cavern we 
                live in, the river we get our water, the patch of grass we run around in. You can 
                see the sunset from up there, it makes the whole sky turn an unworldly gradient of colors.
                <br>
                <br>
                I found the spot while taking a walk the other day.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought I wouldn't be able to take him there anymore.
                <br>
                <br>
                But then, you stumbled across a wounded fox, on the side of the road. You stopped 
                your big box, and climbed out. You wrapped up my leg up in something, and you let me go.
                <br>
                <br>
                And for that, I thank you.
                <br>
                <br>
                I owe you one, big not-fox looking creature.
                <br>
                <br>
                I hope to meet you again some day.

            <p>Week 1</p> <!-- February 14th to February 20th -->

            <p><i>"No matter if it rains or snows, the mail must go through!"</i></p>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">
                A smartphone's custom alarm rings on a bedside table in a small town in the middle 
                of somewhere. A pair of arms emerge, stretching out under the bed covers. A loud yawn, 
                and the arms come down. 6:00 AM; the start of a mailman's day. He jumps out of bed, 
                ready to start his daily routine. Takes a shower, brushes his teeth, and then onto 
                the kitchen where he cooks his breakfast: oatmeal with various fruits (raspberry is 
                his favorite), some milk, and a touch of honey. Before eating, he opens the window 
                to let in the cool autumn air. He takes a deep breath, and smiles. A perfect day to 
                go for a walk.
                <br>
                <br>
                The porcelain bowl, stainless steel pot and spoon are rinsed in the sink, and then 
                placed into the washing machine. Dish soap, close the door, button two, five, and 
                then the one at the very end. One last quick trip to the restroom, and then it's time 
                to put on some proper clothes.
                <br>
                <br>
                A dull blue bag, worn but obviously well maintained, hangs from a hook mounted to 
                the wall next to the door. The color of the bronze hook looks polished where the bag 
                strap sits. The bag has a pocket for a water bottle, some extra socks and a little 
                pouch full of daily essentials: pen, paper, house keys, etc. A blue jacket and hat both 
                rest on a simple coat hanger, also by the door. The post office logo sits proudly on 
                the jacket shoulder sleeve.
                <br>
                <br>
                The mailman sits down on a little stool by the door and he puts on his freshly shined 
                shoes. Left foot, then right foot, "Double Slip Knot" on both. He stands, puts on his 
                jacket and hat, and throws on his bag over his shoulder. He opens the door, walks 
                through, and takes out his keys.
                <br>
                <br>
                The fire alarm rings.
