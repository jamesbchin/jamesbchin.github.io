                A smartphone's custom alarm rings on a bedside table in a small town in the middle 
                of somewhere. A pair of arms emerge, stretching out under the bed covers. A loud yawn, 
                and the arms come down. 6:00 AM; the start of a mailman's day. He jumps out of bed, 
                ready to start his daily routine. Takes a shower, brushes his teeth, and then onto 
                the kitchen where he cooks his breakfast: oatmeal with various fruits (raspberry is 
                his favorite), some milk, and a touch of honey. Before eating, he opens the window 
                to let in the cool autumn air. He takes a deep breath, and smiles. A perfect day to 
                go for a walk.

                The porcelain bowl, stainless steel pot and spoon are rinsed in the sink, and then 
                placed into the washing machine. Dish soap, close the door, button two, five, and 
                then the one at the very end. One last quick trip to the restroom, and then it's time 
                to put on some proper clothes.

                A dull blue bag, worn but obviously well maintained, hangs from a hook mounted to 
                the wall next to the door. The color of the bronze hook looks polished where the bag 
                strap sits. The bag has a pocket for a water bottle, some extra socks and a little 
                pouch full of daily essentials: pen, paper, house keys, etc. A blue jacket and hat both 
                rest on a simple coat hanger, also by the door. The post office logo sits proudly on 
                the jacket shoulder sleeve.

                The mailman sits down on a little stool by the door and he puts on his freshly shined 
                shoes. Left foot, then right foot, "Double Slip Knot" on both. He stands, puts on his 
                jacket and hat, and throws on his bag over his shoulder. He opens the door, walks 
                through, and takes out his keys.
