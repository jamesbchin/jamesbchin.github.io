                There's a gorge, a short bike ride from my house. It's 
                pretty deep, carved and weathered down by millions of years 
                of erosion by the Steven's River. I always found it funny that 
                the river had the same name as me. Maybe my parents named me 
                after the river? Or maybe it was a coincidence.
                <br><br>
                When I was a kid, I used to bike down the river path every 
                weekend with my parents. There are bridges, built over the 
                river at regular intervals, so people don't have to walk too 
                far to get across. My parents and I would bike down one side 
                of the river, across a bridge, and the bike back on the other 
                side. Every now and then, we would go a little farther, taking 
                the next bridge before making the longer trip home. Eventually 
                I got too old, or maybe my parents got too old, or too busy, 
                but we stopped going together at some point.
                <br><br>
                So I started going by myself. Every several months, I would go 
                to a further bridge, continuing the tradition. One of those 
                days, I found a small little cliff overhang, tucked behind the 
                trees. It was purely by chance, I just happened to get a flat 
                tire one day and so when I pulled over to the side of the road, 
                I saw it, just beyond the trees separating the path from the 
                several hundred feet drop.
                <br><br>
                I brought a chair out there, an Adirondack chair. I brought it 
                over in pieces, to not raise any suspicion. Eventually I had 
                my own little spot, overlooking the gorge that runs through 
                the center of my town.
                <br><br>
                I go there whenever I need to think, whenever I need to be 
                alone. As far as I know, no one has ever been here besides 
                me, and so it's a great place to just, take a step away 
                from life and everything.

                But today, in a large glass bottle, I found a note, and a 
                ballpoint pen. I opened the bottle and pulled out the note 
                and it said, Who are you?
                <br><br>
                Distressed, but also curious, I opened the pen and wrote 
                down, "Sturge, who are you??" underneath the original message. 
                I resealed everything and left the bottle on the chair.
