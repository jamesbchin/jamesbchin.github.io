                "Does he have big muscles?"
                <br><br>
                "Is he really tall?"
                <br><br>
                "DOES HE HAVE MONEY?"
                <br><br>
                "Gals, come on. Would I even consider a guy if he didn't have all of those things?"
                <br><br>
                "Well there was this one time..."
                <br><br>
                "Okay woah there, how was I supposed to know that he was a... nerd..."
                <br><br>
                "Ew gross, don't even remind us."
                <br><br>
                The girls shudder, trying to shake the memory from their brains.
                <br><br>
                "Well, tell us everything!"
                <br><br>
                The girls crowd around, waiting to hear all about Cindy's latest hookup.
                <br><br>
                "Well, his name is Trent..."
                
                <br><br><br><br>
                
                "Is she sexy? Dude she better have had a nice butt."
                <br><br>
                "Yeah bro, she better have had some NICE curves."
                <br><br>
                "So was her butt big?"
                <br><br>
                "You what about her feet? Were they nice."
                <br><br>
                All of the guys look over to the last one, and all shift a seat down.
                <br><br>
                "Oh come on guys, it's not that weird."
                <br><br>
                The guys shake their heads, and look back at Trent.
                <br><br>
                "Guys, homies, buds, what girl is worth anything without a bubble butt?"
                <br><br>
                "YOOOO scoreeeee!"
                <br><br>
                "Home run dude!"
                <br><br>
                "Did you get her number?"
                <br><br>
                Trent waves them all down. "Calm down calm down, I'll tell you guys all about 
                her. Let me take a chug of my beer first."
                <br><br>
                He grabs his mug and downs the whole thing, and slams the mug on the table.
                <br><br>
                "So, her name is Cindy..."
