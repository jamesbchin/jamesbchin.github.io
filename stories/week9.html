                It was a dark and stormy night. You are in a pub, enjoying your third mug of apple juice. You sit 
                alone, in the corner of the room, watching the room. A hooded figure with a large wooden staff come 
                in through the door and starts walking towards you. The hooded figure sits down at your table.
