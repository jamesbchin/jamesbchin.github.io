            <h3>one story per week</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Week 17.1</p> <!-- June 6th to June 12th -->
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                "Why won't you let go of me?"
                <br><br>
                "I am looking for adventure, and you are my ticket to the great unknown!"
                <br><br>                
                "You are so annoying, you know that?"
                <br><br>
                "Adventure is for those brave enough to do whatever is necessary!"
                <br><br>
                Percy sighed, but he could do nothing about his fate, and thus kept on 
                driving. He accidentally picked up a hitchhiker and, well, has been 
                unable to get rid of him.
                <br><br>
                It's a funny story though, really, how Percy managed to accidentally 
                pick up this adventurous child. A story for another time, but a story nonetheless.
