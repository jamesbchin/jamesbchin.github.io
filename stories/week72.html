            <h5>The Balcony</h5>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                The Chris Jean Convention Center used to be a major landmark in the small 
                city (or large town) of Port Johnson. It was a large glass building, the 
                size of several stadiums. It wasn't particularly tall for it's width, but 
                it was pretty wide; the building stood taller than most in the general 
                downtown area.
                <br><br>
                At the present day though, it lays dormant. Due to bankruptsies and company 
                mergers and other large tech giant business crap, the largest company in the 
                area, and therefore all of its employees, were moving to a "real city". Port 
                Johnson is being abandoned.
                <br><br>
                Peter Johnson walked up the stairs. The "Canal Staircase" is what the local 
                high school band unofficially named Staircase C, it being the closest to the 
                canal and all. The Canal Staircase was where all the suspicious high school 
                band schenanigans used to happen, because it was almost always abandoned.
                <br><br>
                Before performances, Peter used to come early and walk up the staircase up to 
                the top floor. There was a balcony up there, and one of the doors had a 
                broken lock.
                <br><br>
                Seventh floor, eighth floor, ninth floor... three more floors to go. Peter 
                pulled his phone out of his backpack, and checked his notifications for the 
                first time since the previous morning. Zero new messages. He let out a resigned 
                sigh, and put his phone back into his bag.
                <br><br>
                He continued to walk up, not noticing the footsteps behind him, walking in 
                step with him, a couple floors below.
                <br><br>
                The man below wore a long black jacket and black sunglasses. Underneath was 
                even more black; he wore a black turtleneck long sleave shirt and loose 
                fitting black slacks. He walked up the stairs lightly, making very little sound.
                <br><br>
                Peter got to the top floor, and walked through his normal door. The rapid shift 
                from dark to light was blinding at first but, once his eyes adjusted, the view 
                was as astonishing as ever.
                <br><br>
                He walked over to the edge of the balcony and dropped his backpack at the base 
                of the railing. He knelt down and opened the bag, pulling out a couple of 
                unsealed envelopes, addressed to various people. Each envelope contained a handwritten 
                letter. Peter opened each one and made sure the name on the letter matched the 
                name and address on the envelope, before sealing each of them, one by one.
                <br><br>
                After sealing the last letter, he stood up, and threw the letters over the side 
                of the building. They each fluttered away, each in a separated direction. He 
                took a breath and climbed up to the top of the railing. He counted down from ten.
                <br><br>
                The door behind him opened, slowly and carefully, and the man in the jacket stepped 
                out. He waved his hand and muttered something under his breath as Peter got to 
                "two... one..."
                <br><br>
                Peter closed his eyes and took one last breath before stepping out. He fell for 
                a second before... an energy field appeared below him, catching his fall as if 
                it were a net. It lifted him back up to the balcony.
                <br><br>
                The man with the long jacket closed the door and smiled, as he walked back down the stairs.
