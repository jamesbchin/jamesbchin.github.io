                Don't let me forget the smell of the Japanese Cherry Blossom candle burning on my bedside table.

                Don't let me forget the creak of the door every morning as I walk into the bathroom to take a shower with my honey/almond bar of soap.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget the biting cold of the winter, or the warmth of the fireplace on a snowy day. Donâ€™t let me forget the pictures in frames on the mantle. Pictures of Darcy, Edward, little Timmy.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget the sound of the river running behind my house, as it runs over the large river stones and into the nearby lake.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget you, my friend. My best friend.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget the sounds of the farmers market, every Saturday morning. The smells of fruits and vegetables, the taste of fresh honey, the never ending conversations, the laughter.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget the creak of the door, as I walk into the bathroom, to take a shower with my lavender bar of soap.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget the spring showers, the smell of rain and wet grass and the soaked earth.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget the pictures, above the fireplace. The ones of Daisy, and Edison.
                <br><br>
                Don't let me forget you, whoever you are.
                <br><br>
