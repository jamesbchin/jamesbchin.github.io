                “I have been planning this my entire life,” she said. She waved 
                her hand in front of the nearby wall, and another shimmery silver 
                portal faded into existence. She pulled Chris over to the portal. 
                He saw a little girl on the other side, sitting on a bed in a 
                dark room. The portal glitched a little but stayed connected.
                <br><br>
                Amy pointed at Chris, and said “Amy, you need to find this one. 
                You are gonna spend a big part of your life looking for him. 
                It’s important.”
                <br><br>
                The little girl on the other side of the portal nodded her head. 
                Amy put her hand in her jacket pocket and pulled out a black box 
                wrapped in a big, silky silver ribbon. She opened it, and inside was 
                a phone and a ring. The phone and ring were brand new, unlike her own, 
                however they had the same silver accents that her own phone and ring 
                had. Amy closed the box, and then made a motion indicating to her 
                younger self that she was going to throw her something. Younger Amy got 
                ready, and Amy threw the phone into the portal.
                <br><br>
                “You’re gonna need this.”
                <br><br>
                The younger Amy caught the device and nodded her head. Amy smiled, and 
                waved her hand towards the wall, closing the portal. She turned back to 
                Chris, her eyes starting to water.
                <br><br>
                “I have to leave now, Chris. I won’t see you for a while, but please 
                don’t forget me?”
                <br><br>
                “How could I forget you?” Chris said with a smile, offering his arms.
                <br><br>
                She gave him a hug, tears now coming down her face. With one last squeeze, 
                she let go. She took a small box out of her pocket and handed it to Chris.
                <br><br>
                “It doesn’t work, it’s just a replica. But, something to remember me by?”
                <br><br>
                Chris accepted the box. It was very small, and was also wrapped in the same 
                silky silver ribbon. He almost couldn’t see the box underneath all of the red.
                <br><br>
                He opened it, and inside was a black ring. It had gold adornments on it, 
                nlike the silver on Amy’s, but it was seemingly identical otherwise.
                <br><br>
                Chris looked up to say thank you but, Amy was already gone.
