                It all began on a dark and stormy night... and then the sun came up!
                <br><br>
                John Winters was an average dude that had a killer beard and no 
                mustache. He wore a really small hat with a giant feather attached 
                to it. When he walked around, people called him Bob.
                <br><br>
                He was going to the grocery store one day in his car when all of a sudden, 
                a bird came and stole his hat. Feather and all! John was sad, but it 
                was okay, because he made it to the grocery store.
                <br><br>
                He bought a new hat at the grocery store, and then left on his brand 
                new bike, that he also bought at the grocery store.
                <br><br>
                He went biking down the road, and stopped at a green light. While waiting, 
                he noticed a really scared looking squirrel in the middle of the street, 
                petrified. No one would stop for it! So he yelled "by the powers vested in 
                me by the Brotherhood of Chipmunks, I gift you with the power of flight!â€œ. 
                And then the squirrel
                <br><br>
                John got home and jumped onto his couch made of cardboard and he fell 
                through it. Then he sat in it all afternoon, waiting for the planet 
                Jupiter to rise into the sky, giving him a sign that it was time the sleep.
                <br><br>
                Jupiter never appeared, and so John never went to sleep.
                <br><br>
                He and the squirrel and the chipmunks and the bike lived happily eve...
