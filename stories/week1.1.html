                "HOLY SHIT I am so gonna die." â€¦ is what I thought that day.
                <br>
                <br>
                I didn't think it was possible for anything to move that fast, and never did I think 
                something that fast would be coming at ME. Except maybe when I bring home a freshly 
                hunted rabbit for my pups. They definitely come at me pretty fast.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought about them, that day. Little Ginger is only a couple days old, just 
                popped out of my mate. She's so cute, the little one. She definitely gets her genes 
                from her mother.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought, why was I so dumb, tripping over a crack in the ground, breaking my leg 
                when I did. Now some massive creature is gonna come eat me, and my mate will have 
                to fend for herself and our three little pups.
                <br>
                <br>
                How could I put her through that.
                <br>
                <br>
                You know, now that I think about it, I was gonna take my son, Acorns, out to a 
                beautiful cliff that night. It over looks the whole forest-- the little cavern we 
                live in, the river we get our water, the patch of grass we run around in. You can 
                see the sunset from up there, it makes the whole sky turn an unworldly gradient of colors.
                <br>
                <br>
                I found the spot while taking a walk the other day.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought I wouldn't be able to take him there anymore.
                <br>
                <br>
                But then, you stumbled across a wounded fox, on the side of the road. You stopped 
                your big box, and climbed out. You wrapped up my leg up in something, and you let me go.
                <br>
                <br>
                And for that, I thank you.
                <br>
                <br>
                I owe you one, big not-fox looking creature.
                <br>
                <br>
                I hope to meet you again some day.
