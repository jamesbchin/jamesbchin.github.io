            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                Hello everyone. My name is Tim, and I’m about to give 
                a bomb of a speech right now to my man, Rich Douglass. Let’s all 
                give it up for my best bud and his better half, Hillary.
                <br><br>
                Now, to tell the story. To be honest with you folks, I wasn’t there 
                for this. But Rich has told me this story so many times, I honestly 
                could’ve been there.
                <br><br>
                So… Rich was on the ground. Face squished against the pavement in 
                front of his parents’ house, unfortunately large bloody gashes on 
                his cheek. Honestly probably an unfortunate sight. (Also yes, my 
                bro over here was still living in his mom’s basement in his late 
                twenties. We all make fun of him for it.)
                <br><br>
                “Oh my god, are you okay?”
                <br><br>
                Rich jumped up, or at least, he tried to. He hit the side of his 
                head and his ears pretty hard; his balance was completely off. He 
                stumbled while trying to get up. (Note to the audience, he got a minor 
                concussion. He got it checked and confirmed the day after.) He felt a 
                hand on his arm, pulling upwards.
                <br><br>
                “You seem to be in a rush somewhere,” she said with a smile, helping 
                Rich back onto his feet. He stumbled a bit, but her grip was firm, and 
                she steadied him. “Here, why don’t we sit down.”
                <br><br>
                So there was a small wooden bench swing in front of the Douglass’ house. 
                Funny story really. Mr. Douglass built the bench with his father, and Mr. 
                and Mrs. Douglass actually ended their first date on this bench.
                <br><br>
                Anyway, she walked him over and they both sat down. She opened her bag and 
                pulled out a water bottle, and handed it to him.
                <br><br>
                Rich let out a sigh. “Thank you,” he said before opening the bottle and taking a sip.
                <br><br>
                “Where were you going in such a rush?”
                <br><br>
                Rich took another sip of water and looked over at the spot he fell on. There 
                were small spots of red on the light gray pavement. He started to put the cap 
                back onto the bottle, “I was on my way to the Eastview Café.”
                She smiled again. (Rich used to always say that Hillary’s eyes glistened whenever 
                she smiled. I’m sure this was one of those times.) Rich handed the bottle back to her 
                and she put the bottle back into her bag. “That’s where I’m going too,” she said, as 
                she got up from the bench. She extended her hand, offering Rich some assistance. He 
                accepted and placed his mildly shaking hand into hers. As he tried to get up though, 
                he stumbled and fell to the ground again.
                <br><br>
                “Okay okay, maybe not. Let’s just sit here for a bit,” she said, as she helped Rich 
                get back up onto the bench.
                <br><br>
                “What did I even trip on?” Rich looked around and found a dirtied yellow extension 
                cord lying in front of his front door. It wrapped around the house, likely connected 
                to the circular saw his father was using in front of the garage.
                <br><br>
                “I really need to get to the café though, I’m going to be late,” Rich said, as he 
                tried to stand up again. He was shaky but, he managed to stand on his own (just barely, 
                but he was standing nonetheless). His legs shook, and his head floated around as if 
                it were being blown around in the light wind. He started to walk to the sidewalk.
                <br><br>
                “Hey woah, are you sure you’re ready?” she said, starting to go after him.
                <br><br>
                “Not really but, I can’t be late, I have a date!” Rich said, walking backwards but 
                picking up speed. He seemed to be stabilizing a little.
                <br><br>
                “Hey wait up! I’m actually also on my way to a date.” 
                <br><br>
                They walked for a little walk, talking about little things. Like how the weather was 
                really nice that day, or how the tree leaves were changing colors in preparation for 
                the upcoming autumn, or how they both happened to be carrying black sling bags.
                <br><br>
                “Wait, what’s your name? I can’t believe I haven’t asked until now.”
                <br><br>
                “Oh, it’s no big deal. You did just hit your head. My name is Hillary.”
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                And that, everyone, is how my man here, Richard Douglass, found his Mrs. Douglass. 
                Turns out, they were both set up on the same blind date. Apparently they found it 
                hilarious, and they spent the rest of the day together. When Rich got back home, he 
                cut a piece of the extension cord and saved it. The metal that was used to make Hillary’s 
                engagement ring? Yeah, that came from that cord.
                <br><br>
                But I digress. These two were set up to go on a blind date with each other, and yet 
                still met ahead of the intended time. It’s almost as if the universe decided that these 
                two belong together, but the Fates just couldn’t wait any longer. And so, now that you all 
                know that these two were meant to be, I present to you, the newly wedded couple, Richard 
                and Hillary Douglass.
