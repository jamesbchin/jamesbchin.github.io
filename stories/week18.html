                Today is the first day of the annual Autumn Festival. Although a small 
                town, friends and family from all over come back on this day to celebrate 
                the town's biggest event of the year. The first day of the festival is 
                always on the first Friday night of the season. Kids mark their calendars 
                before they go off to college, so that they can come back Friday afternoon 
                to just make it to the first night. There are fun rides and outdoor games, 
                haunted houses and escape rooms. There are snacks and candy and food and 
                drinks. The night is a fun night for everyone, young and old.

                "I thought I'd find you up here," a voice said, followed by the very 
                distinct sound of a shuffling pair of converse across concrete. He shuffled 
                over to their favorite spot on the overlook and stood beside her. He places 
                his hand on her shoulder for a second, before lifting both arms around the 
                overlook fence. They stood in silence for a while, listening to the sounds 
                and watching the lights of the festival. The sky was just starting to change 
                color, from the brilliant blue of the day to a slightly... orange-y blue.
                <br><br>
                She picked her head up, looking away from the festival and towards the 
                small, lightly gray colored clouds up in the sky.
                <br><br>
                "I got my last college letter today," she said, softly, and monotoned.
                <br><br>
                "Yeah I... I heard. It's why I figured you'd be up here."
                <br><br>
                She turned to him, her face stone cold, emotionless. "I came up here to be alone."
                <br><br>
                His eyebows furrowed and twitched, like the gears inside his mind didn't 
                quite compute. He slowly turned to her, but faced the ground in front of 
                her. "Really? â€œ
                <br><br>
                "Yes really. Why did you come here."
                <br><br>
                He looked up, still puzzled. "I figured you would be distressed, moving 
                all the way across the country?"
                <br><br>
                She turned back to face the town. "It'll be a long time before we see 
                each other again."
