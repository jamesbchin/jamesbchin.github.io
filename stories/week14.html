                Is it better to know that something is slipping away, or to never 
                know of its existence. Blissful ignorance or unfortunate truth.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, some of us don't have the luxury of choice.
                <br><br>
                It's like an addiction. It is an addiction. Just one more time, 
                just one more time. A never ending question to answer. Can I have 
                just one more?
                <br><br>
                Every spell, every little bit of magic, takes time off your life. Every 
                tiny little itsy bitsy taste of the art, brings you that much closer to 
                death. Some try to calculate how much magic they have left. Some try to ration 
                it, some have more of a #yolo approach to life. And some don't do the math. 
                Some just live their lives, using magic only when absolutely necessary.
                <br><br>
                Magic users get exactly 150 years to live. Or so we think. No magic user has 
                ever lived that long, most averaging a death at around 60 or so. The most 
                skilled of us all are among the youngest, only practicing their power when 
                absolutely necessary, performing the most beautifully crafted spells. They spend 
                their time studying, thinking, simulating. Practice is a curse.
