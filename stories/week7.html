                "I don't think you should tell anyone."
                <br><br>
                She was wearing a white lab coat. One of those, fancy, down to the knees, too clean to be a real piece of clothing in a hospital, coats. She was holding a clipboard, likely containing information about my upcoming demise.
                <br><br>
                She jots some stuff down, and clips her pen to the top of the clipboard. "A nurse will be with you shortly, take your vitals and all that. Do you have any questions for me?"
                <br><br>
                I had so many. Why was I there? What was wrong with me? When did I get there? I tried to speak but words wouldn't come out.
                <br><br>
                "Great. I probably won't see you again so, good luck!"
                <br><br>
                She walked out, as if she had more important things to do. Which, I'm sure she does, but it kinda sucked to feel like that.
                <br><br>
                I sat there for a while. I think there was a clock but I don't remember what it said. I just remember the ticking. Tick... tick... tick... The clock had no care in the world. No matter what happened around it, time moved on. Forever, unending, and always at the same rate.
                <br><br>
                "Can I have your finger please?"
                <br><br>
                The nurse was there, offering that little clip that measures heart rate. I never understood how that little thing determined your pulse from your finger. It seemed so far away from the source. How was there no delay, between the beat of my heart and some magical receiver on the tip of my left index finger.
                <br><br>
                I extended my finger, and she clipped it with that little magical black device. "Righty or lefty?"
                <br><br>
                I lifted my right arm, to indicate that I wrote with my right. Surprisingly, I did everything else with my left. But by the societal definition of the word "righty", I am indeed a righty.
                <br><br>
                She wraps the cold blue cuff around my left arm and pushes a button on a wall. After squishing my arm and a couple of beeps, the nurse writes down some numbers.
                <br><br>
                "10 days. Use them wisely."
                <br><br>

                Day 2:
                <br><br>
                I should write everything down.
                <br><br>
                I must have blacked out yesterday, I don't remember arriving home from the hospital. My studio apartment was exactly as I left it. My desk was full of paperwork from work and takeout boxes from, god knows how many late nights. Dirty laundry all over the floor. I don't remember the last time I did the dishes.
                <br><br>
                I really need to clean up.
                <br><br>
                Day 3:
                <br><br>
                I decided not to clean up. With the exception of needing to go to the bathroom on occasion, and ordering a very large and unhealthy pizza, I didn't leave my bed yesterday. Why should I bother cleaning up? It's not worth it. There's no point, after all.
                <br><br>
                I called in sick at work today. I wasn't feeling well. My stomach was grumbling. Not in a hungry kind of way, more like, a the-world-is-ending-butterflies kind of way. My phone rang a few times throughout the day. I set my phone to do not disturb.
                <br><br>
                Maybe I should clean the studio.
                <br><br>
                Day 4:
                <br><br>
                I keep a dream journal. It was just some notebook I got at some flea market somewhere. I was buying a bedside table, and the book was on the table. The seller said I could have the notebook for free if I bought the table, so. Here I am, with a bedside table and a notebook.
                <br><br>
                It wasn't a particularly fascinating book. Hardcover, lined pages, a pen slipped into the spiral binding. There was a name written on the inside of the cover. I could never make it out.
                <br><br>
                It sat on my bedside table for a while. I didn't know what to do with it, until one day I woke up from a really sweat-inducing dream. I had to write about it, and so my dream journal was born.
                <br><br>
                Here's my most recent entry, from last night.
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    Night 136
                    <br><br>
                    I was in a forest. I think. Everything was calm, warm. Sun was shining. And then there were animals running fom something. I don't know what. I ran with them. I was scared of getting run over. Running became really hard. I couldn't breathe. I kept trying to run but all of the animals kept running faster. My eyes started blacking out. I couldn't stop running, but I also couldn't run.
                    <br><br>
                    And then I woke up.
                    <br><br>
                    Not the most pleasant dream. But these haven't been the most pleasant days.
                </i>
                <br><br>
                Day 5:
                <br><br>
                I still haven't cleaned my studio. At some point I decided to get out of bed though. I started to clean my dishes, but the overwhelming sentiment of Nietzsche's words kept coming back to haunt me: “Regarding life, the wisest men of all ages have judged alike: it is worthless.”
                <br><br>
                Don't think I'm cool or anything, I had to look that up.
                <br><br>
                Nothing really exciting happened today. I did catch a couple fruit flies though.
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    Night 137
                    <br><br>
                    I don't remember much this time. I do remember falling though. I remember falling, from the top of a building. A skyscraper. I don't remember how I started falling, but I remember falling. And then I was falling into nothing. My body started to itch, in that way it does when I get bored. That feeling of, I need to be doing something, but I can't.
                    <br><br>
                    I eventually fell into my bed.
                    <br><br>
                    And I woke up.
                </i>
                <br><br>
                Day 6:
                <br><br>
                I forgot about my phone. Not that I ever really get any messages, or phone calls, or any sort of notification really. But on occasion.
                <br>
                I got a couple of missed calls. Some text messages. All from my supervisor. I think I saw the word "fired" in one of them. I decided to ignore them.
                <br><br>
                I think now would be a good time to clean the studio. Right?
                <br><br>
                Day 6.5:
                <br><br>
                I have never seen this studio so clean. The clothes dryer is still running, and so is the dishwasher, but otherwise.
                <br><br>
                I broke out the Lysol, for the first time in, probably since I bought the bottle. It was coated in spider webs (gross, I know). The tiled floors in the bathroom and kitchen are so shiny, I didn't realize that "shiny" was its original finish.
                <br><br>
                The fridge was full of old food. Moldy, rotten, probably long expired food sat in the fridge. So I took it all out. Anything that looked mildly old got chucked in a brand new garbage bag. I brought it outside, to the garbage room of the apartment complex.
                <br><br>
                It's been a while since I left the studio.
                <br><br>
                Day 7:
                <br><br>
                I have a balcony in this studio. I don't spend much time out there, but I figured now was a good a time as any. I brought my computer desk chair out there. My studio is on the fifth floor of the complex. It has an okay view of the city. People walk by all day, although sparingly. I don't live on a major street, I couldn't possibly afford that.
                <br><br>
                There's a building right across from mine, only four stories high. There's a small bodega on the bottom floor. I haven't spent much time there. Actually, I don't even remember what it looks like inside.
                <br><br>
                Will I ever get to visit now?
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    Night 139
                    <br><br>
                    I was at a train station. Or at least, I thought it was a train station? There were a lot of people, some at booths seemingly to buy tickets, others running to various unknown locations in this gigantic building.
                    <br><br>
                    I walked through the station. I don't remember much, but I remember walking for seemingly forever.
                </i>
                <br><br>
                Day 8:
                <br><br>
                I was trying to decide if I should leave the apartment. I pulled out some dice and started rolling. If I roll an even number, I'll go outside.
                <br><br>
                I rolled a 2.
                <br><br>
                So I rolled again. If it's an even number, I'll go outside.
                <br><br>
                I rolled a 4.
                <br><br>
                So I rolled again. If it's an odd number, I'll go outside.
                <br><br>
                I rolled a 3.
                <br><br>
                So I put the dice away and pulled out a coin.
                <br><br>
                Heads, I go outside, tails I stay inside.
                <br><br>
                I flipped, and it landed on the floor.
                <br><br>
                I went back to bed.
                <br><br>
                Day 9:
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    Night 141
                    <br><br>
                    I was boarding a train. I can only remember flashes.
                    <br><br>
                    I was at a terminal of some kind. I could've sworn it was for buses, but there were trains? I don't know how to explain.
                    <br><br>
                    People were bumping into me, all leaving the train I was trying to get to. Eventually I managed to get to the train doors.
                    <br><br>
                    I jumped on, movie style. The train was already moving, I was running after it, and then I jumped on.
                    <br><br>
                    Then I was sitting in a chair. My row was empty, but the train car was really loud.
                    <br><br>
                    The ticket guy came around, and asked me for my ticket.
                </i>
                <br><br>
                Day 10:
                <br><br>
                I gave up on writing yesterday. But today is today, and so I couldn't bring myself to fully quit.
                <br><br>
                I spent a good portion of the morning just sitting on the foot of my bed, thinking about all of the things I haven't done. I've always wanted to go scuba diving. Ever since I was a kid. I don't know if it's because I don't know how to swim, or because scuba diving is just cool. I've wanted to write a book, or something. Or maybe I don't. I think I just want to be known for something. For people to remember my name.
                <br><br>
                Maybe after today, someone will remember me.
                <br>
                Maybe.
                <br><br>
                Good night.
                <br><br>

                <i>
                    Night 133
                    <br><br>
                    I was in bed, I think. Someone was talking to me. She was wearing some white jacket thing. It was a long jacket. She said something to me but I don't remember what.
                    <br><br>
                    She walked out. It felt cold in the room.
                    <br><br>
                    I waited for a while. Or I didn't wait at all?
                    <br><br>
                    Someone else walked in. She mumbled something. She asked me something.
                    <br><br>
                    I couldn't move. I couldn't talk. I felt paralyzed.
                    <br><br>
                    She said something. I think it was... 10?
                    <br><br>
                    I don't know what the significance was.
