                    Look Chris, high school is about to be over. I'm writing in your 
                    YEARBOOK for crying out loud. You have one day left before we 
                    all go our own separate ways and you never get to see her ever 
                    again. What do you have to lose?
                <br>
                    Trust me man, you're gonna regret this for the rest of your life. 
                    What are you wai

                "GRANDPAAAAAA, IT'S TIME TO EATTTTT"
                <br>
                <br>
                A young little girl came running up the stairs, fork in one hand and 
                some tomato sauce in the other. "We're eating spaghetti and meatballs today!"
                <br>
                <br>
                Grandpa Chris laughed. "Hey Susie, what did your mother say about 
                running with sharp things in your hands?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Grandpa Chris slowly closed the book he had opened on the table. He let out 
                a sigh, and walked over to where Susie was standing. She frowned, and handed 
                him the fork. Susie turned and ran down the stairs, with Grandpa Chris 
                walking down behind her. By the time Grandpa Chris made it to the dining room, 
                Susie was already sitting down, eating another meatball, with her hands of course.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Wow look who decided to join us!" Susie's father said, while grabbing a plate 
                for his father. "How's the… attic? Is that where you were?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Grandpa Chris nodded and took a seat beside his granddaughter, accepting the 
                plate from his son. He asked for the pitcher, and proceeded to pour himself a 
                glass of homemade raspberry iced tea. He also poured some for Susie, knowing that 
                raspberry iced tea is Susie's favorite drink.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Grandpaaa, my favorite drink isn't raspberry iced tea anymore. It's strawberry milk!"
                <br>
                <br>
                Grandpa Chris sat silently for most of dinner.  The family eating in the background 
                faded away; Susie's mother spent a fair amount of time trying to teach her daughter 
                how to eat the pasta and meatballs but, no matter how hard she tried, pasta sauce 
                still seemed to end up everywhere.
                <br>
                <br>
                After dinner, Susie and her family thanks Grandpa Chris for inviting them over for 
                dinner. As they walked to the car, Susie broke free from her mother's hands and ran 
                back to Grandpa Chris, giving him one last big hug.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Don't worry Susie, I will see you soon." Grandpa Chris wiped the tears coming down 
                Susie's face. She nodded, and then she ran back to her mother.

                "There are never any appropriate words to describe a sunset."
                <br>
                <br>
                There was this trail nearby, seldom walked by anyone, mostly because it wasn't 
                really a trail. But if you take a left off of the actual trail, in between two 
                large oak trees, and fight the never ending branches of downed trees and thorny 
                bushes, you'll find this small little rocky beach, facing towards the west.

                They were sitting on a large flat rock, the same flat rock that they always sit 
                on. Their backpacks were behind them, sitting on a small blanket so that there 
                was no sandy evidence on the bottom of their bags.
                <br>
                <br>
                The spring breeze was chilly; they were wearing each others sweaters, switched 
                long before they traversed the jungle between the real world and this one.
                <br>
                <br>
                "I'm gonna miss this place."
