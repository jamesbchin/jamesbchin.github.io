            <h5>A Moment in Time</h5>
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                After years of setting up a massive server, capable of storing several 
                thousands of terrabytes of data, with unbelievable bandwidths, the 
                prototype is complete. A device capable of storing a full virtual model 
                of the planet, a single frozen moment in time. And all it took was a 
                gigantic computer, and a virus.
                <br><br>
                Several months ago, a virus was created and spread out amongst the 
                constellation of devices that make up the Earth. Over time, it hid, 
                propogating in the shadows. Eventually every single connected device, 
                every computer and phone and refrigerator and satelite had a copy of the 
                virus. And they lay dormant, sleeping, until the master server was built, 
                and called the start function. Once called, every device uses its full suite 
                of internal and external sensors, and creates as good of a 3D map of its 
                surroundings as it can, and sends it to the central server.
                <br><br>
                Once the data is collected, the server cautiously stitches every mini 
                environment together, until it completes its single purpose in life: 
                to save a single moment in time, forever.
