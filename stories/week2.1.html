            <p>Week 2.1</p> <!-- February 21st to February 27th -->
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                "Something bothering you?"
                <br>
                <br>
                Startled, the kid takes his forehead out of his hands, immediately sitting straight 
                up, as if someone had poked his side and ran away. He took a quick look around the 
                station, trying to figure out who was talking to him.
                <br>
                <br>
                He sat alone on a wooden bench. The station was quiet, there were only a few people 
                around. Some with their noses in books, other with their dreary eyes glued to their 
                smartphone screens. A few were sleeping, leaning on the poles holding up the station roof. 
                It was late, the kid was coming back from his job working as a barista at the local late 
                night coffee shop.
                <br>
                <br>
                The voice spoke again, "Stop looking around doofus, I'm on the phone. You must be using 
                your new earbuds again."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Oh… right… sorry about that."
                <br>
                <br>
                "It's good dude, no biggie. What's stressing you out?"
                <br>
                <br>
                He didn't remember calling anyone, much less who he would call at this hour. But he 
                appreciated the company nonetheless.
                <br>
                <br>
                "What if I really am just a terrible person?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "What makes you say that?"
                <br>
                <br>
                He leans back in the chair, thinking back to his earlier interaction with his classmate 
                at school.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well, I told, what's his name, Stephen? I told him that he was a terrible programmer 
                with no future because he didn't finish his part of the group project in time."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well, is he a terrible programmer?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well, to be honest, I am a much better programmer than he is. I swear Brenden wouldn't 
                be able to program a toaster if his life depended on it."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Well screw him then!"
                <br>
                <br>
                "But maybe I was too hard on him, you know? What if he was just busy or somet…"
                <br>
                <br>
                "No, evidently this guy is useless. You need to drop him."
                <br>
                <br>
                "You sure?
                <br>
                <br>
                "Look, is he useless? Does he contribute anything to the team?"
                <br>
                <br>
                He pauses for a moment. He thinks for a moment, and then stands up.
                <br>
                <br>
                "You know what, you're right. Who needs Brayden anyways."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Yeah there you go!"
                <br>
                <br>
                "He's probably one of those babies that cries to their babysitters."
                <br>
                <br>
                "That's right!"
                <br>
                <br>
                A light appears from the nearby tunnel. A train whistle goes off, and the wind from 
                the incoming train blows by.
                <br>
                <br>
                "You know what, I'll kick him off the team tomorrow. This god damn kid is bringing 
                down the team."
                <br>
                <br>
                "That's the spirit!"
                <br>
                <br>
                The train comes to a stop, and the doors open.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Thanks man, I really needed that."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Any time bro."
                <br>
                <br>
                The kid walks through the double doors. They close and the train starts moving. 
                He takes a seat by the window. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his earbuds, and 
                starts playing some music.
