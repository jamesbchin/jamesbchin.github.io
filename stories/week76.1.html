                "Don't give up."
                <br><br>
                The voice was light and comforting, and yet it sounded hardened. 
                It punched through the bright white light. A hand appeared, 
                extended out, offered.
                <br><br>
                I took it, and was lifted up out of my bed. It was weird, 
                floating there above the doctors and nurses who, just a moment 
                ago, were frantically trying to keep me alive. Now, everything 
                sat completely still, frozen in time.
                <br><br>
                I turned to face the owner of the hand who pulled me out of my 
                body. I had never seen this man before but, his face was... 
                familiar. Something didn't feel right.
                <br><br>
                He was old. Streaks of gray have propagated through his hair 
                and his skin looked weathered.
                <br><br>
                I shook my head, breaking out of the trance. "Don't give up? 
                Do you see my face? What about my body? Is there any part of 
                me that isn't broken right now?"
                <br><br>
                The old man winced a little. His eyes lost focus for a second, 
                as if remembering and old memory. "I know it doesn't look 
                good but, you can't give up."
                <br><br>
                Time started moving again. Everything was in slow motion.
