            <p>Week 11</p> <!-- April 25th to May 1st -->

            <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;margin:5px">
                I am always left in some random place. On his desk, on his bedside table, 
                on the bed, on the floor NEXT to the bed. To be honest, it's quite the thrill, 
                when I come off of his face, trying to figure out where I might end up. Maybe I 
                will spend some time with the stuffed animals next to his bed, or maybe I will 
                spend some quality time with the various pens and pencils and other random junk 
                he has on his table. Or worse, maybe I'll end up sitting on his bed while staring 
                at his lame face while he's sleeping.
                <br><br>
                But regardless of where he puts me, he always forgets where he put me. Sometimes 
                I'll be right next to his face and he'll just wake up, and walk around hopelessly 
                for several minutes, trying to remember where he put me.
                <br><br>
                Maybe if he just put me in the same place every night, he wouldn't have this 
                problem! Like a normal person!
                <br>
                But noooooo he has to just throw me wherever is most convenient, whether that 
                be right next to his pride and joy, his phone, or on the god damn floor.
                <br><br>
                He is so lame.
