We had a sumptuous dinner, including roast suckling pig, conch and scallop in bird's nest, jumbo shrimp with walnut, shark's fin soup, abalone, crispy fried chicken, lobster, steamed fish, fried rice, e-fu noodles, red bean soup, cookie, fruit platter, and wedding cake. There was a lot of dancing by the hosts and guests. I especially enjoyed the performance by hula dancers.</p>

<p><b>2010-09-05. Cathy Yee and Edwin Cortés Wed</b></p>
<p><a href="../in-laws/pikfei4-family/pikfei4.html">Cathy Yee</a> and <a href="../in-laws/pikfei4-family/pikfei4.html">Edwin Cortés</a> had a small (Cathy's word) wedding in Puerto Rico on September 5, 2010. The Chinese reception was held in Arlington (Rosslyn), VA on October 23, 2010 at the China Garden Restaurant. Unfortunately I was not able to attend the wedding in Puerto Rico but had lots of enjoyment when my family and I joined the festivities at China Garden. The dinner was lavish. Worthy of note was a dish with three lobsters. I had seen two lobsters served in many banquets, but never three.</p>
<p>Cathy's hometown is Silver Spring, Maryland. She is a planner at Johnson & Johnson. Her special interests include traveling to random places, trying new activities, dancing like no one's watching, shopping until she drops, running, and googling 24/7. Edwin's hometown is Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. He works as a law clerk for a Federal Judge. His special interests include rooting for the Dallas Cowboys and the Pacers on game days,   watching action-packed movies, dining out at his favorite restaurants, and spending quality time with friends and family.</p>

<p><b>2010-05-16. Chén Coat of Arms</b></p>
<div align="center">
  <img src="../images/chen-coat-of-arms.jpg" alt="Chen Coat of Arms" width="177" height="179">
</div>
<p class="ch-m">此圖爲陳姓圖騰. 圖騰是古代氏族的族徽. 陳姓是以封地爲姓氏的. 陳本來是太昊氏炎帝及其後裔的天文中心. 陳姓圖騰由  [ 東 ]  和  [ 太陽升降的階梯 ]  組成:東爲日在木中, 木又叫扶木或建木 ( 扶木即扶桑,它和建木一樣都是古代神話傳説中的一種樹木, 用來觀測太陽的高度, 以此來制定曆法 ) 等. 樹立 [ 扶桑 ( 古代神話傳説中的一種樹, 用來觀測太陽的高度, 以此來制定曆法  )  ]  或  [ 扶木 ] 等的地方爲  [ 陳 ], 古代有陳倉, 陳留, 陳地等, 它們都是天文觀測中心, 也都是當時的首都或京城.</p>
<p>This image is the coat of arms of the Chen Family. The coat of arms was the Old Clan's emblem. The surname Chen came from the enfeoffed land called Chen. Chen was originally the astronomical center of the descendants of Taihao and Yandi. The Chen coat of arms has the form of "east" and "sunset and sunrise step ladder" and later became "sun in the middle of tree". This "tree" was also called the "help tree" or "construct tree".  "Help tree" was also called "help mulberry".  The "help tree" or "construct tree" was an ancient mythical tree used to observe the altitude of the sun to create the model for a calendar.  In ancient times there were place names beginning with Chen, such as Chen Cang, Chen Liu, and others. These places were all astronomical observatory centers and later became capital cities.</p>

<p><b>2010-05-16. Generation Poem</b> </p>
<p>班次聯 bāncìlián or 派字歌 pàizìgē is a poem of various lengths. Ours is four lines with five characters each. It began in the thirteenth generation from Chén Mó 陳謨 (1173 - 1242 ) with a four-line poem written by Chén Bái Shā 陳白沙 (1428 - 1500), a Ming dynasty naturalist thinker, life scientist, poet, calligrapher, and educator. It was continued with another twenty characters written by Chén Bó Táo 陳伯陶 (1855 -1930), a Qing dynasty writer, until the 52nd generation. A person's hào 號 comes from the generation poem for that person's particular generation. For example, my grandfather belonged to the 24th generation and his hào 號 was Xù Yè 煦業. One of the characters for his hào 號 must contain  Yè 業 and the other character was chosen by his father.  The hào 號 was conferred in a ceremony at our ancestrial temple when he was married.  This custom was not universally practiced at all villages. Some males and females may also be given a hào 號 even at a very young age. The hào 號 is a title of respect and from the time the title was conferred my grandfather was known as Chén Xù Yè 陳煦業 from that point forward. The hào 號 also defines a person's bānpài 班派, that is, a person's generation. This is especially important when one addresses one's elders. Thus, if a person's  hào 號 has the character Yè 業 in it, I know immediately that I should address him as granduncle, Gōng 公, unless he was my grandfather, in which case, I would address him as Yé 爺, paternal grandfather. Males in our village who were my father's generation (25th), Guāng 光, would be my uncles. If they were older than my father, they would be addressed as Bó 伯. If they were younger than my father, they would be addressed as Shū 叔. If males in our village are in the same generation as me and older than I am, I would address them Gē 哥. If they were younger, I address them by their given name.

<p class="ch-s">The first 20 characters were written by Chen Bai Sha (1428-1500 CE) for Chen Mo’s fourth son Chen Wen Qi starting from the 13th generation.</p>
<p class="ch-m">
Eminent classical literature will prosper for many generations
In response to an auspicious dynasty and the kindness of a nation. 
The honor of moral conduct and achievement will shine into the distant future.
Obeying the law will be protracted forever.</p>
<p class="ch-s">
The second 20 characters were written by Chen Bo Tao (1854-1930 CE) as a continuation of Chen Bai Sha’s poem for the next 20 generations until the 52nd generation.</p>
<p class="ch-m">
Benevolence and generosity will be graciously extended to the people.
A literary atmosphere will enlighten the talented and conscionable people.
The glory of one's fatherland will be dazzling.
Continuous study will develop one's fame.

<p><b>2009-12-23.</b> A new version of the Huang Village Family Tree has been uploaded today. It now traces our ancestry back to the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) who reigned from 2697 BCE to 2598 BCE. Portraits of Huangdi, Shundi, and the five Chen Dynasty emperors have been added. I am now working on getting portraits of Chen Hugong (the first Chen) and Chen Shigong.
<p>Thank you, Steve Chan, for getting more photos for the site and adding more members of your father's family. It was a pleasure meeting you and your daughter, Jessica.</p>
<p>The numbers in the first column of each chart are generation numbers. The first number counts from Huangdi (The Yellow Emperor). The second number counts from Mangong (Chen Hugong), the progenitor of the Chen/Chin/Chan/Chinn/Chun/Tan/Tran clan. The third number counts from Shigong, the protector of Yingchuanshijun 穎川始郡, which is where most of the southern Chen/Chin/Chan/Chinn/Chun/Tan/Tran people came from. The fourth number is counting Chen Mo, the first of seven sons of Chen Hui. Many of the Chens in the Taishan District in Guangdong are descended from Chen Hui.</p>

<p><b>2009-05-03.</b> About 10 days ago Dr. Tan Chee Lin, Philip 陳志仁 of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia invited me to join Geni.com, a genealogy site. Tan is another spelling of Chen/Chin/Chan/Chun/Chinn/Tran (陳/陈). He is my 50th cousin thrice removed. It is a very cool site that shows how the Chins/Tans are related to each other, can enter wives and daughters, and it goes all the way back to our very first ancestor, the Yellow Emperor 黃帝 who reigned from 2697 BCE to 2598 BCE. Philip Tan is still working on uploading more village zupus (族譜)  or clan genealogy.  I have uploaded part of the Huang Village Chin Family Tree and invited some of you to join. I can only invite those whom I have e-mail addresses. If you wish to be invited, please e-mail me at genechin718@aol.com.</p>
