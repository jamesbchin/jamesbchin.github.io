<p class="gene"><strong>Xuangong</strong> (Chinese: 宣公; pinyin: Xuāngōng) was the Sixteenth Marquis of Chen Guo. In 672 BCE his concubine, Biji (Chinese: 嬖姬; pinyin: Bìjī) gave birth to Kuan (Chinese: 款; pinyin: Kuǎn) and she wanted Kuan to be the crown prince instead of his half-brother Yukou (Chinese: 御寇; pinyin: Yùkòu), Biji had him killed.
In the previous generation, Wan's father, Ligong (厲公), had killed Mian, Wan's oldest brother, who was at that time the crown prince. Wan thought that his cousin, Xuangong, might suspect that he had something to do with the murder, very similar to his father's situation of uncle killing nephew - he being the uncle and Youkou, the crown prince being the nephew. Thus, he fled to Qi Guo (traditional Chinese: 齊國; simplified Chinese: 齐国; pinyin: Qí Guó) and changed his surname to Tian (Chinese: 田; pinyin: Tián). He is the progenitor of the Tian family. Xuangong reigned for 36 years.  He died in 657 BCE. His posthumous name was Chujiu (Chinese: 杵臼; pinyin: Chǔjiù).</p>

<p class="gene">The crown prince, <strong>Yukou</strong> (Chinese: 御寇; pinyin: Yùkòu), whose mother was from the Zhu (Chinese: 朱; pinyin: Zhū) family, was killed by his father's concubine, Biji, in favor of her own son, Mugong (Chinese: 穆公; pinyin: Mùgōng).</p>

<p class="gene"><strong>Mugong</strong> (Chinese: 穆公; pinyin: Mùgōng) was the Seventeenth Marquis of Chen Guo. He reigned for 16 years and died in 633 BCE. His posthumous name was Kuan (Chinese: 款; pinyin: Kuǎn).</p>

<p class="gene"><strong>Gonggong</strong> (Chinese: 共公; pinyin: Gònggōng) was the Eighteenth Marquis of Chen Guo. He reigned for 18 years and died in 614 BCE. His posthumous name was Shuo (Chinese: 朔; pinyin: Shuò).</p>

<p class="gene"><strong>Linggong</strong> (traditional Chinese: 靈公; simplied Chinese: 灵公; pinyin: Línggōng) was the Nineteenth Marquis of Chen Guo. Xia Zhengshu (Chinese: 夏征舒; pinyin: Xià Zhēngshū) killed Linggong because he insulted him. Linggong's son Wu (Chinese: 午; pinyin: Wǔ) fled to Jin Guo (traditional Chinese: 晉國; simplified Chinese: 晋国; pinyin: Jìn Guó). Xia Zhengshu proclaimed himself as the Marquis of Chen Guo. In 598 BCE Chu Chuangwang ( traditional Chinese: 楚莊王; simplified Chinese: 楚庄王; pinyin: Chǔ Zhuāngwáng) led the feudal lords against Chen Guo under Xia Zhengshu. After he killed Xia Zhengshu he recalled Wu to continue his father's reign. Linggong reigned for 15 years. His posthumous name was Guoping (traditional Chinese:  國平; simplified Chinese: 国平; pinyin: Guópíng).</p>

<p class="gene"><strong>Chenggong</strong> (Chinese: 成公; pinyin: Chénggōng) was the Twentieth Marquis of Chen Guo. He reigned for 30 years and died in 569 BCE. His posthumous name was Wu (Chinese: 午; pinyin: Wǔ).</p>

<p class="gene"><strong>Aigong</strong> (Chinese:  哀公; pinyin: Āigōng) was the Twenty-First Marquis of Chen Guo. His first wife, Zheng Ji (traditional Chinese: 鄭姬; simplified Chinese: 郑姬; pinyin: Zhèng Jī) bore Dao Taizishi (traditional Chinese: 悼太子師; simplified Chinese: 悼太子师; pinyin: Dào Tàizǐshī). His second wife bore Yan (Chinese: 偃; pinyin: Yǎn). His third wife bore Liu (Chinese: 留; pinyin: Liú). His fourth wife bore Sheng (traditional Chinese: 勝; simplified Chinese: 胜; pinyin: Shèng). Aigong doted on Liu and asked his brother Gongzi Zhao (Chinese: 公子招; pinyin: Gōngzǐ Zhāo) to care for him. When Aigong became ill in 534 BCE, Gongzi Zhao killed Dao Taizishi and established Liu as the new crown prince. Aigong became very angry and wanted to punish Gongzi Zhao. Gongzi Zhao raised his army and attacked Aigong from all sides. Aigong committed suicide. Gongzi Zhao established Liu as the new Ruler of Chen Guo. Dao Taizishi's son, Wu (traditional Chinese: 吳； simplified Chinese: 吴; pinyin: Wú) fled to Jin Guo (traditional Chinese: 晉國; simplified Chinese: 晋国; pinyin: Jìn Guó). In the fourth lunar month Gongzi Zhao sent a messenger to Chu Guo (traditional Chinese: 楚國; simplified Chinese: 楚国; pinyin: Chǔ Guó) to report on this situation. When Chu Lingwang (traditional Chinese: 楚靈王; simplified Chinese: 楚灵王; pinyin: Chǔ Língwáng) heard the news that Chen Guo was in chaos, he killed the messenger and sent Qi Ji (traditional Chinese: 棄疾; simplified Chinese: 弃疾; pinyin: Qì Jí) to attack Chen Guo. Liu fled to Zheng Guo (traditional Chinese: 鄭國; simplified Chinese: 郑国; pinyin: Zhèng Guó). In the eleventh lunar month, Chen Guo fell. Qi Ji declared himself the new Ruler of Chen Guo. In 529 BCE Qi Ji assassinated Chu Lingwang and declared himself the new king, Chu Pingwang (Chinese: 楚平王; pinyin: Chǔ Píngwáng). Because Chu Pingwang wanted to be peaceful with the neighboring feudal lords, he asked Dao Taizishi's son, Wu, to come back and be the Marquis of Chen Guo. </p>

Shī), was killed by his uncle, Gongzi Zhao (Chinese:  公子招; pinyin: 
Gōng Zǐ Zhāo). </p>
