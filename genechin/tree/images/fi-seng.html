<h3>G. I. Prayer</h3>

<p class="aftermu">
Written by F. S. Chin<br />
Somewhere in China, 1946<br />
Found on March 3, 1985 </p>

<p class="gene">
Please God, please remember us.<br>
We are the ones that were in Saipan.<br>
We are the ones that were on the beach of Normandy.<br>
We are the ones in Okinawa, Burma, India, and China.<br>
We are the ones in the far reaches of all the world.<br>
When our souls were on trial there, we looked up to you.<br>
And your smile came; we were assured, we came through.<br>
People say we have won,<br>
But you know what we have done, don't you?<br>
Today in this quiet moment of gratitude once more we are on trial.<br>
Once more we look up and ask your guidance.<br>
We ask nothing of you - nothing, O Lord, nothing save this!<br>
Please smile again. Please remember us<br>
In peace as you did so dearly in war. Amen.
