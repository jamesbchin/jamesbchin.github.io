Start looking at the Family Tree by clicking on any of the four indices in the first row above. The 英文目錄 English Index is sorted in the order of the English alphabet. The 中文目錄 Chinese Index is sorted according to the 康熙字典 Kangxi Dictionary (1716 C.E.) order using radicals and stroke counts. The 拼音目錄 Pinyin Index is sorted by using Microsoft Excel. The 台山拼音目錄 Hoisanva Index is sorted by using Microsoft Excel with minor changes to group the same characters together. All four indices are arranged with the Chin (Chan, Chen, Chinn, Chun, Tan, Tran and other variations in romanization) members first, followed by relatives whose surnames are not Chin. The main portion displays our family tree. Enjoy!

	<p>宗能叔 (Chĩn Düng Nãng) who, in 1995, gave me a copy of the Huang Village Chin Family Tree manuscript without which this project would not have been possible, 琴姊 (Kim Lee) who gave me a copy of her father's abbreviated manuscript of the family tree and who identified many of our relatives in old photographs, 珍珠妹 (Ginger Chinn) who gave me words of encouragement and many photographs in her collection, 健民哥 (Ging Chin) whose interest in the family tree encouraged me to continue with the project, 晃斌哥 (Bin Fong Chin) who provided invaluable information about the 德性 (Āk Xëin) branch of the tree, 長婆 (黃彩雲) who contributed many photographs from the 祥沾 (Tẽng Jëm) branch of the family tree, 艳影 (Yanying) who contributed the many village photographs and some very helpful commentary on my photographs, my wife Pikfei ("Kee") who was patient enough to struggle through some difficult passages with me, my mother who provided some colorful stories of our village folks, my children and grandchildren who will hopefully enjoy this site and keep it up-to-date, and to my father Fee Sheung Chin who sent me to Columbia College in New York City, which offered Chinese courses and to whom this site is dedicated.

The third number is counting from Shigong. The fourth number is counting from Mo. The generation name is also given starting with the 13th generation from our Great Ancestor Mo [traditional Chinese: 謨; simplified Chinese: 谟; pinyin: Mó; Hoisanva: Mũ]. When a person has a generation name, the personal name is shown in brackets. <a href="12-2zhongqian.html"> Generation poems</a> were established for several branches of our family starting from the 13th generation.</p>
