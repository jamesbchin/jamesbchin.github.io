<p>THE THIRD GENERATION</p>
<p>
<b>仲真 Jùng Jïn</b> was our third generation Grand Ancestor. He had a special name, Màn Ngĩn Èik 萬人敵 (Wànréndí). He was the fourth son of 文起 Mũn Hī. The Southern Song [government] made him a field officer in charge of station garrisons to grow their own food. [For meritorious deeds] he was imperially conferred the title of "The Appeaser". [Posthumously, he was better known as] Chĩn Lāo Gön 陳老官 (Chén Lǎoguān). He married a Jïn 甄 (Zhēn), a Lãi 黎  Lí, and a Màk 麥 (Mài). His tomb and his wives' tombs were in Suī Chẽin Bön Gëin 水埕半逕 (Shuǐchéngbànjìng) in the shape of a flying goose facing east. <b>仲真 Jùng Jïn</b> had two sons. The first born was 希堯
Hï Ngẽl and the second was 希聖 Hï Sëin. They moved to Võng Tûn Kūng Füng 潢村孔峰 (Huángcūnkǒngfēng) and lived there. 希聖 Hï Sëin's children and grandchildren moved to 水南 Suī Nǎm (Shuǐnán) and lived there.
