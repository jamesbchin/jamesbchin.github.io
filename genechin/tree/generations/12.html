<p><b>婆生 Pũ Säng </b> was the first son of 雲穀 Vũn Gūk. He married a woman from the Äng 鄧 (Dèng) family. His tomb was in Ngùk Vâi 玉槐 (Yùhuái) in the form of a sitting fairy facing south. Because he had no children he bequeathed his fields to other relatives so that they would pray for him.</p>

<p><b>仲乾 Jùng Kẽin </b> was the second son of 雲穀 Vũn Gūk. He married a woman from the Lī 李 (Lǐ) family. His tomb was in Ngùk Vâi 玉槐 (Yùhuái) in the form of a sitting fairy facing south.  He had two sons, 如璋 Nguĩ Jëng and 如金 Nguĩ Gïm.</p>

<p><b>仲倫 Jùng Lũn </b> was the third son of 雲穀 Vũn Gūk. His style name was Ngèin Sẽng 彥常 (Yàncháng). His generation name was Huï Hẽin 虛亭 (Xūtíng). He was born in 1475 C.E. at 5:00 to 7:00 A.M. on the fifth day of the ninth moon. He became a teacher in his own school for thirteen years in Göng Xäi Gīt Ön Fū Vêin Nẽin Yǒn 江西吉安府永寧縣 (Jiāngxī Jíānfǔ Yǒngnìngxiàn) until he died on the job in the 4th day of the 7th moon of his 16th year of teaching in 1499 C.E. His tomb was in Sän Dū Hǎng 山子坑 (Shānzǐkēng) facing ENE 3/4N or 60 degrees. His wife was from the Lī 李 (Lǐ) family. Her tomb was in Xäm Gâp Huǐ Hèo Lũng 三合墟後龍 (Sānhéxūhòulóng) in the shape of a beautiful girl looking at a mirror. He had one son, 善道 Sên Ào.</p>
<p>There may be a discrepancy in the recording of the birth and death dates for 仲倫 Jùng Lũn. According to these dates, he died at 24 years of age and the text said that he taught for 16 years, which means he had to start teaching at age 8. This is possible, but not very likely.</p>
