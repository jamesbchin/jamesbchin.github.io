<p>THE FIRST GENERATION</p>
<p><b>謨翁 Mũ Yǔng</b> was a successful candidate in the highest imperial examination in the Southern Song Dynasty and was awarded the seat of Vice President of the Board of Punishment. He was unable to take the position because it was necessary to flee and hide in Gōng Üng 廣東 Guǎngdōng Province. He lived in Gū Göng Āk Hãng Lǐ 古岡德行里 (Gǔgāngdéhánglǐ).</p>

<p>He was born in the ninth year [1173 C.E.] of the reign of Emperor Kẽin Ào 乾道 (Qiándào) [during the Southern Song Dynasty]. He died in the second year [1242 C.E.] of Emperor Sũn Yiù 淳祐 (Chúnyòu). His tomb was in 平安 Pẽin Ön (Píng’ān).</p>

<p>His first wife came from the Võng 黃 (Huáng) family. She was the second daughter of Guï Güng 居公 (Jūgōng) of Bāo Chëng Yǒn 保昌縣 (Bǎochāngxiàn). Because her maternal uncles, Võng Yîn Lũng 黃隱龍 (Huángyǐnlóng) and Võng Yîn Fu 黃隱虎 (Huángyǐnhǔ) had problems with a 胡妃 Húfēi [a Hu imperial concubine], they traveled with them to Gông Jiü 岡州 (Gāngzhōu) and lived in Sêh Häng Tǔn 社坑村 (Shèkēngcūn).</p>

<p>She had four sons: 文詵 Mũn Xëin, 文振 Mũn Jīn, 文龍 Mũn Lũng, and 文起 Mũn Hī. Her tomb was in Lũng Suī Ù Hū 瀧水都土 (Lóngshuǐdūtǔ).</p>

<p>謨翁 Mũ Yǔng married his second wife [in 1231 C.E.]. She was from the Jëng 張 (Zhāng) family. Her tomb was in Chüng Gïm Sěk Dël Lũng Sän 沖金石焦龍山 (Chōngjīnshíjiāolóngshān). His third wife came from the Jï 朱 (Zhū) family. Her tomb was in Üng Gōn Yǒn 東莞縣 (Dōngwǎnxiàn).</p>
