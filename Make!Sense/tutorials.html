        <h1>Setting Key Strokes on the Make!Sense Configurator</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        The Make!Sense Configurator is used to tell the Make!Sense board
        what to output to the computer when a sensor outputs a certain 
        value to the board. An example would be the board outputting the
        character "A" when a button is pressed, or outputting a left 
        arrow key when a potentiometer is turned to the left. This 
        system allows the board to be universal and easy to use.
        <br />
        <h2>Output the Letter "A"</h2>
        The first step is to download the Make!Sense Configurator. Click 
        the button below to download it:
        <a href="data/configurator.zip" download="MakeSenseConfigurator">

          </div>
        </a>
        The next step is to plug a button into the Make!Sense board. For
        this tutorial, plug it into port 0. Please note that all of the
        ports are the same and any sensor can be plugged into any of
        the ports.
        <!--Insert picture of putting the button into the board here-->
        <br />
        As seen in the picture, there are three blue terminal blocks per
        port. The first port is for power, the second is for input, and 
        the third is for ground.

        <h1>Experiment Examples</h1>

        <h1>Speed Calculator</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        In this experiment, we will use a Range Finder in order to determine
        the velocity of a moving object.
        <h2>What is a Range Finder?</h2>
        A range finder is a sensor that measures distance. If you look at a
        range finder, you'll notice that it has two eye-like things. One is
        used to send out something (like sound or light), and one is used to 
        receive it when it returns after bouncing off an object. This is 
        similar to echolocation.
        <h2>Velocity</h2>
        Velocity is equal to the displacement divided by the time. In simpler
        terms, it's speed. In order to calculate this in this experiment, we
        will be using the displacement measured by the range finder and the
        time measured by the Make!Sense board.
        <h2>Building</h2>
        Grab an object that can move and mount the range finder on it facing 
        backwards. Place this object in front of a wall of some kind and have
        the object face away from it.

        <h1>Encoder</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        By counting the number of rotations of a wheel and doing a little math, 
        we can calculate the velocity of an object.
        <h2>What are Encoders?</h2>
        Encoders are sensors that are used with motors to measure rotation. 
        These are used everywhere, one example being robots. By being able to 
        measure rotations, a robot can be told to go to an exact place.
        <h2>Math</h2>
        In order to calculate distance traveled, we're going to need to do a 
        little math. The distance traveled in one rotation is equal to the 
        circumference of the circle.
