        <h1>Setting Key Strokes on the Make!Sense Configurator</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        The Make!Sense Configurator is used to tell the Make!Sense board
        what to output to the computer when a sensor outputs a certain 
        value to the board. An example would be the board outputting the
        character "A" when a button is pressed, or outputting a left 
        arrow key when a potentiometer is turned to the left. This 
        system allows the board to be universal and easy to use.
        <br />
        <h2>Output the Letter "A"</h2>
        The first step is to download the Make!Sense Configurator. Click 
        the button below to download it:
        <a href="data/configurator.zip" download="MakeSenseConfigurator">

          </div>
        </a>
        The next step is to plug a button into the Make!Sense board. For
        this tutorial, plug it into port 0. Please note that all of the
        ports are the same and any sensor can be plugged into any of
        the ports.
        <!--Insert picture of putting the button into the board here-->
        <br />
        As seen in the picture, there are three blue terminal blocks per
        port. The first port is for power, the second is for input, and 
        the third is for ground.
