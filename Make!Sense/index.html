          <h1>Make!Sense Board</h1>
          Unlike any other board on the market, the Make!Sense 
          board gives teachers the ability to teach kids about 
          the wonders of engineering, while keeping it simple 
          enough for kids to understand.
          <br /><br />
          By plugging in various types of sensors into any of 
          the eight available ports on the Make!Sense board,
          students can learn to manipulate data coming from 
          those sensors on the computer.
          <br /><br />
          The Make!Sense board is a small and simple tool that 
          gives students access to a world that is much bigger, 
          a world that is only limited by ones imagination and
          creativity, the world of making.
