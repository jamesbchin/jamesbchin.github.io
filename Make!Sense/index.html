          <h1>Make!Sense Board</h1>
          Unlike any other board on the market, the Make!Sense 
          board gives teachers the ability to teach kids about 
          the wonders of engineering, while keeping it simple 
          enough for kids to understand.
          <br /><br />
          By plugging in various types of sensors into any of 
          the eight available ports on the Make!Sense board,
          students can learn to manipulate data coming from 
          those sensors on the computer.
          <br /><br />
          The Make!Sense board is a small and simple tool that 
          gives students access to a world that is much bigger, 
          a world that is only limited by one's imagination and
          creativity, the world of making.

          <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
          The Make!Sense board has eight connections ports. This means
          that any amount from zero to eight sensors can be plugged
          into it to feed data into a computer. It does this by
          acting like a keyboard and outputting keystrokes. These 
          keystrokes can be configured using the MakeSense 
          Configurator, which is shown on the right.
          <br /><br />
          Because the Make!Sense board outputs keystrokes, it can be
          used to send data to a wide variety of programs. One
          examples is Scratch by MIT. Scratch, a program designed
          for teaching young students about the wonders of computer
          programming, works very well with the Make!Sense board, 
          because Scratch uses key strokes as input for its programs.

        <h1>Sensors</h1>
        The Make!Sense board is used to input information from
        the outside world into the computer. This allows programs
        to respond to external stimuli, making them smarter and
        more useful. There are many different types of sensors, but
        there are two main categories: digital and analog.

            one of two values, HIGH or LOW. HIGH means ON, and
            LOW means OFF. Examples of sensors that output digital
            signals are buttons, switches, and touch sensors.</td>

            any value from 0 to 1023. 0 in analog is equal to LOW
            in digital. 1023 is equal to HIGH in digital. Examples
            of sensors that output analog signals are potentiometers, 
            photoresistors, and temperature sensors.</td>
